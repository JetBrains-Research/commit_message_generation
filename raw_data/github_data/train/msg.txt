Add DEFAULT _ BEHAVIOR to companion object of MaterialDialog
Invert if condition for better readability \n This refactoring inverts the if condition in removeDuplicates ( ) method \n for better readability of code and aligns with the intent described in \n the javadoc for the method
Rename test to execution to better reflect intent
Increase heap memory to avoid continuous Full GCs \n test - hive - pushdown - filter - queries - basic tests need a larger heap to \n smoothly run to completion . With the current default heap size of 2GB \n we consistently see Full GCs . This change will increase it to 4GB .
Skip logging of GCStatusMonitor state if there is no activity \n Don ' t print headers when there are no active queries / tasks to avoid \n polluting log files .

Fix order of PersistentTreeMap ' s kvreduce \n We need an in - order traversal to make stuff happen in sorted order . So \n rather than self / left / right , we do left / self / right . \n Signed - off - by : Stuart Halloway < stu @ thinkrelevance . com >
Fix handling of Reduced values in PersistentTreeMap / kvreduce \n It was dereferencing them and passing them up the chain ; but that meant \n that parent nodes didn ' t know the reduction had completed , so the \n reduction might continue along other paths down the tree . \n Signed - off - by : Stuart Halloway < stu @ thinkrelevance . com >
Add tests for sorted - map reduction problems \n Signed - off - by : Stuart Halloway < stu @ thinkrelevance . com >
Fix UOE when building exists query for nested search - as - you - type field ( # 64630 ) \n PrefixFieldType can use the default existsQuery ( ) implementation . \n Fixes # 64609
Fix bug in ObjectMapperTests . testMerge ( ) ( # 64626 ) \n This test checks that the dynamic propertly on ObjectMappers can \n be updated through a merge . We need to directly retrieve the merged \n result by calling MapperService # merge , because if we randomly \n pick MergeReason . MAPPING _ UPDATE _ PREFLIGHT as the merge \n reason then the mappers do not get updated in - place within the \n MapperService .
Fix array handling in XContentMapValues . extractRawValues ( ) ( # 65193 ) \n When an array is encountered while following a path through the map , \n we should only add array values if we ' re at the final path . So following the \n path ` foo . bar . baz ` shouldn ' t add concrete values that sit in the array \n at ` foo . bar ` .
SourceValueFetcher should check all possible source fields ( # 65375 ) \n This commit fixes a bug where SourceValueFetcher was returning \n an empty set of values if any of its source fields were empty ; instead , \n we skip over the empty value and continue collecting from all other \n source fields .
Remove unused typeText field from DocumentMapper ( # 67646 )
Simplify field name lookup in MatchQuery ( # 67973 ) \n MatchQuery needs to resolve field aliases before it builds its internal \n queries . It currently checks for aliases by calling simpleMatchToFieldNames \n but this is in fact unnecessary , as getFieldType ( ) will already return a \n field type pointing at the concrete fields to be searched , so we can use \n the name of this resolved field type instead .
Correctly set search quote analyzer for keyword fields ( # 68315 ) \n Keyword fields with split _ queries _ on _ whitespace = true were also setting \n whitespace analyzers to be used for quoted queries . Instead , keyword \n fields should always set their searchQuoteAnalyzer to be the same as the \n index - time normalizer . \n Fixes # 68313
Don ' t use ' default ' as the default name for keyword normalizers ( # 68354 ) \n We previously used ' null ' as a placeholder for unconfigured normalizers \n on keywords . With recent refactoring , this was changed to ' default ' , but \n this causes problems for configurations that already have a custom \n normalizer called ' default ' , which now gets ignored . This commit changes \n the mapper back to using ' null ' as a default , and adds a test that you can \n add a normalizer called ' default ' that will be applied correctly .
Adjust YAML test skip value after backport ( # 69105 ) \n Relates to # 68738
Correctly handle nulls when fetching multiple values from source ( # 69062 ) \n If a field contains a single null value that would have been substituted via \n a mapper ' s configured null _ value , then we return this configured value in \n that mapper ' s value fetcher . However , we also need to handle the case where \n the field contains an array , one of which is null . \n Fixes # 68979
HttpCertificateCommand PKCS12 filetype auto - detect in JDK16 ( # 68072 ) \n JDK16 updated the default encryption and MAC algorithms used in PKCS # 12 . \n Because of it , the empty keystore fingerprint ( the first two bytes ) has changed . \n This PR updates the PKCS12 detection rule so that the http certificate command \n identifies empty keystores created in JDK16 .
Append priv for _ aliases over metricbeat - * for monitoring agent ( # 69212 ) \n This adds the privilege for the ` _ aliases ` action for the ` metricbeat - * ` index \n namespace to the ` remote _ monitoring _ agent ` built - in role ( used by metricbeat \n agents ) . This is required ( at least ) when creating ingest indices that have aliases . \n Notably , this change permits metricbeat agents to delete indices via the \n ` remove _ index ` action , which is undesirable but we have no way around it , \n at the moment .
Fix azure repo stream exhaust check for multipart uploads ( # 66769 ) \n This PR fixes the validation of the conversion from an input stream to a flux in the \n AzureBlobStore ' s multipart update logic , which erroneously checked that the upload \n input stream is exhausted after each part ' s flux is completed .
OpenIdConnectAuthIT ' s client uses certificate _ authorities instead of trustore ( # 67093 ) \n This PR makes it so that the test code of OpenIdConnectAuthIT can be run \n under our FIPS JVM setup . \n In particular , the client ' s SSL context is built from certificate authorities \n from a crt file instead of from a trustore from a JKS file .

Refactor AssumptionTests to use try - catch ( # 1299 ) \n Use a try / catch block instead of the attribute ' expected ' of the @ Test annotation . \n See bug # 1290 . \n See discussion on # 1289 .

ZoomableDraweeView : fix missing transformation callback if image loading is slow \n Summary : \n ` DefaultZoomableController ` exposes a listener for transformation changes , ` Listener # onTransformChanged ( Matrix transform ) ` . \n However , the listener is currently only invoked if the controller is enabled . This works fine if the image has been loaded already and anything else triggers another transformation change . \n If image loading is slow ( e . g . if it ' s a big image that is not in memory already ) and there is no other transformation change ( e . g . bounds change , listeners will miss the final transformation event since the controller is still disabled when the final image is set .

Do not create Array instance in kotlin - reflect where not necessary \n Although the previous code of computing JVM internal name from a Class \n instance was shorter , it led to unnecessary creation of array types , \n which is less performant and makes configuration of kotlin - reflect for \n GraalVM native - image more verbose . \n Unfortunately I didn ' t succeed in writing a test for this , since \n ` Array . newInstance ` calls a native method which doesn ' t record any trace \n of it being called in the class loader : the resulting array type never \n goes through findClass / loadClass , and is not visible via \n findLoadedClass . \n # KT - 44594 Fixed

Apparently kotlin - reflect doesn ' t work \n without some services in META - INF / services / , which didn ' t satisfy the \n condition for inclusion . The existing test didn ' t catch that because \n loading class annotations does not always lead to those services being \n loaded .
Tests : compute runtime classpath for JVM box tests manually \n Taking just the ` jvmClasspathRoots ` is not correct because it also \n contains stuff needed for resolve to work correctly , such as JDK ( full \n or mock ) , stdlib ( full or mock ) , reflect . JDK is obviously not needed in \n the classpath , and stdlib / reflect are available via the parent class \n loader , which is specifically reused across all tests to make them run \n faster . \n Also , don ' t try to create class loader for Java - only modules in \n ` JvmBoxRunner . processModule ` . This happens , for example , for all tests \n which were moved from ` boxAgainstJava ` .

Fix flaky URLConnectionTest . serverShutdownOutput test \n There are usually 2 requests sent to ' / b ' during the test : \n # 1 on the busted connection , attempting reuse \n # 2 on a new connection \n On successful runs , the server recorded # 1 and then # 2 and added them to the queue in that order . \n On failed runs , the server started reading request # 1 before # 2 , but there was a context switch , and it finished reading # 2 before # 1 , recording them in that order . Since # 1 was the last to be recorded , the test incorrectly used it to assert that the sequence number was 0 . Since # 1 was the second to be received on the busted connection , it had a sequence number of 1 so the test failed . \n The fix removes the assumption that # 2 is the last to be recorded . \n Fixes https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4140 .

Assert connection pool eviction in HttpOverHttp2Test . tearDown ( ) \n While investigating https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4470 , I noticed there are sometimes connections left in the pool after calling ConnectionPool . evictAll ( ) in HttpOverHttp2Test . tearDown ( ) . As a result , tests that assume the connection pool is initially empty can appear flaky while the blame is in previous tests , making it hard to debug , and possibly hiding a connection leak bug . \n So far I ' ve noticed the new assertion fails ( very rarely ) when tearing down these tests : \n * recoverFromMultipleCancelReusesConnection \n * emptyDataFrameSentWithEmptyBody \n * gzippedResponseBody \n This change may increase flakiness in the short term , but will make it easier to debug , by blaming the right tests .
Remove duplicate connection pool eviction code \n tearDown ( ) takes care of this .
Test call cancellation while request headers are sent \n Reproduce an issue where canceling an HTTP / 2 request while request headers are sent has no effect . \n Other than being a real issue , this may also be the root cause of https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4470 . \n It seems to be related to the fact that the HTTP2Codec has no stream assigned at that point , so HTTP2Codec . cancel ( ) is a no - op .
Ensure streams are removed from connection within test lifetime \n After the recent fix , if the call is canceled while writing request headers , the stream is eventually removed from the connection . But this is done on a separate thread , and there was previously no guarantee that it would happen before tearDown ( ) is called and the connection pool is evicted , preventing the connection from being evicted before the next test starts . \n Together with https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / pull / 4492 , this will hopefully fix https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4470 .
Make Http2Codec . stream volatile \n It can be referenced from multiple threads . \n I think there is still a thread safety issue with the Http2Stream class .

Fix memory leak in MockWebServer when using ALPN \n Since Platform . afterHandshake ( ) was never called , SSLSockets were not removed from ALPN ' s Map and could not be freed .

Specifically it releases this . streams . Previously WebSocketListener . onOpen ( ) was called after the streams were allocated but before they were assigned to this . streams . As a result the streams were not allocated if WebSocketListener . onOpen ( ) threw . \n Fixes part of https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4515 .

Fix flaky HttpOverHttp2Test . emptyDataFrameSentWithEmptyBody \n The test fails when there is a context switch to the MockWebServer thread after the client sends the HEADERS frame but before it sends the DATA frame . The MockWebServer then reads the client ' s HEADER frame and sends a DATA frame with the response body . As a result , the first DATA frame that is logged is not the expected empty DATA frame sent by the client . \n Fixes https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4757
Fix flaky DuplexTest . duplexWithRedirect \n The test is flaky because the server sometimes acts on the 301 response and resets the stream before the action added by MockDuplexResponseBody . sendResponse ( ) is executed . This action then fails because it tries to write to a reset stream . mockDuplexResponseBody . awaitSuccess ( ) then throws and fails the test . \n The change enforces the de - facto sequence on most runs , where the 301 response is handled only after the Duplex response is sent . \n Fixes https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4743
Fix flaky CallTest . recoverWhenRetryOnConnectionFailureIsTrue _ HTTP2 \n MockWebServer sometimes enforces the DISCONNECT _ AFTER _ REQUEST policy before the client executes exchange . finishRequest ( ) . As a result , Http2Writer . flush ( ) is called on a closed Http2Writer and throws . This causes a RequestFailed event to be emitted instead of the expected ResponseFailed . \n This change enforces the de - facto sequence in most runs , where the policy is applied only after the client finishes writing the request . \n Fixes https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4704

Fix connection leak on failed WebSocket handshake \n Note that as long as there are leaking tests , I can ' t commit an assertion that verifies the fix . Since all tests share the same OkHttpClient and ConnectionPool , a leaking test will cause such an assertion to fail for all subsequent tests . To test the fix , I added an assertion locally and ran each fixed test individually .

Tests : fix testMoveToStepRereadsPolicy flakiness ( # 64466 ) \n testMoveToStepRereadsPolicy relied on an updated ILM policy that had \n a rollover condition that enabled the index to be rolled after one second . \n This changes the test to use a ` max _ doc ` : 1 condition so it ' s under the \n test ' s control to trigger the condition .

ILM : ignore clusterChanged events if state not recovered ( # 67507 ) \n IndexLifecycleService will listen for clusterChanged events in order to \n trigger the async actions when a new master is elected . During the same \n event processing routine determines when a new master was elected ( to avoid \n triggering the async actions multiple times ) . \n However , if it doesn ' t exclude the events based on not fully recovered \n cluster states it will get into a situation where it records the " new master elected " \n but it cannot trigger the async actions because the cluster state does not \n contain the ` IndexLifecycleMetadata ` custom .
ILM : ShrinkStep ignores the isAcknowledged flag on the response ( # 67591 ) \n The ShrinkStep only reported complete if the resize request was acked . If the isAcknowledged \n flag is false though , ILM will not move to the next step , but remain on the ShrinkStep \n and it will attempt to re - execute the step on a master failover . However , the resize request \n was executed and the corresponding cluster change was committed , so the eventual retry will \n not be able to succeed anymore . \n This change makes the ShrinkStep report as complete when a successful ( acked or not ) ` ResizeResponse ` \n is received . The following step in the ShrinkAction , ` shrunk - shards - allocated ` , will \n wait for the shrunk index to be created and for the shards to be allocated .
Tests : ILM full policy allocation action includes more nodes ( # 67706 ) \n * Tests : ILM full policy allocation action includes more nodes \n * Tests : ILM reduce number of shards \n * Tests : ILM allow more time for ILM to progress
SearchableSnapshotActionIT : wait for snapshots to be wiped ( # 68218 ) \n Currently this test can flake becasue the ` searchable _ snapshot ` action waits \n for the mounted index to be ` GREEN ` to consider the mount ( ie . restore ) to be \n complete . But the cluster state notications can yield the index successfully \n allocated ( ie . GREEN ) before the restore listener removes the " restore in progress " \n entry from the cluster state . \n This is a temporary test fix that will have the test wait until all snapshots are \n wiped ( retrying until the snapshot restore is removed from the cluster state )
Fix testIdenticalSearchableSnapshotActionIsNoop ( # 69033 ) \n This fixes the flakiness in testIdenticalSearchableSnapshotActionIsNoop and \n testConvertingSearchableSnapshotFromFullToPartial caused by the fact that we \n enabled ILM for the index and * after that * indexed a document . If ILM runs \n very fast in CI the ` indexDocument ` call could fail , or in the case of \n testIdenticalSearchableSnapshotActionIsNoop all the assertions in the test \n will pass but the final one that checks there is one document indexed fails \n because the ` indexDocument ` call didn ' t execute .

KTIJ - 650 [ Code completion ] : test framework fix \n This commit fixes test infrastructure issue . \n Usage of " COMPILER _ ARGUMENTS " test - data - instruction resulted in side \n effect . Test cases following the one that used it got broken \n LanguageVersionSetting - LanguageFeature . MultiPlatformProjects escaped , \n languageVersion could be wrong . \n Why it happened \n KotlinProjectDescriptorWithFacet defines default values \n of ( language - version , isMultiplatform ) settings for the test - case . \n The values themselves are stored in KotlinFacetSettings and passed there \n only once . After every test - case ( if it uses " COMPILER _ ARGUMENTS " ) \n infrastructure calls \n KotlinLightCodeInsightFixtureTestCaseKt # rollbackCompilerOptions which \n resets mentioned values ( among others ) in KotlinFacetSettings . \n Instances of KotlinProjectDescriptorWithFacet are reused hence facet \n settings remained reset .

Do not update query failureCause when query is FINISHING
Improve error message when transaction is gone \n It can happen if the query finishes before the scan operator is \n done ( e . g . : . . . LIMIT N ) . \n Although the errors after query completion generally should be ignored \n it is still makes sense to have a reasonable error message and \n and explicit null check then simply rely on a null dereferencing inside .
Rename query . initial - hash - partitions property \n Rename the query . initial - hash - partitions to query . hash - partition - count to match \n the session property name
Remove CURRENT _ ROLE from the reserved keywords \n The SQL standard allows queries like : \n ` ` ` \n postgres = # SELECT CURRENT _ ROLE ; \n current _ role \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n postgres \n ( 1 row ) \n ` ` ` \n That ' s why the ` CURRENT _ ROLE ` is a reserved keyword in the SQL standard . \n Currently Presto supports the ` CURRENT _ ROLE ` keyword only in \n ` CREATE ROLE ` , ` GRANT ` and ` REVOKE ` statements . So it is possible to \n parse the ` CURRENT _ ROLE ` token as a keyword in those statements , while \n parsing the same token as an identifier in any other queries . \n However this is only a temporary solution , as at some point the scope \n of the ` CURRENT _ ROLE ` might be extended to the SELECT queries as well .
Fix Hive schema for a table bucketed on 0 columns \n Such a schema is allowed in Hive : https : / / goo . gl / hnxy73 \n Temporary tables can potentially be bucketed on 0 columns . That \n will effectively turn such a table into a single bucket table . \n However there is not fundamental reason why shouldn ' t we support that .

Fix bug in intermidiated data writes stats collection
Limit query submission threads \n Analysis is the part of the submission and when analysing Presto communicates \n with the metastore using the blocking IO . Thus the maximum number of threads \n that handle submission remains high ( twice the number of CPUs ) . \n Callbacks of the FailedQueryExecution and the ResourceGroupManager are supposed \n to be lightweight and low latency . That why the unbounded executor remains to be \n used to handle those .
Compact effective predicate early \n TupleDomain compaction reduces a long list of well specified values to a \n range if the number of values threshold is crossed . \n The compaction has been moved as part of the 76ea27ef commit . \n effectivePredicate is carried to a worker with a HiveSplit . HiveSplit \n must be serialized into JSON on the coordinator . Without a compaction \n the serialization of large tupple domains ( 100 + values ) results in \n excessive CPU usage on coordinator .

Make updateTaskStatus not synchronized within SqlStageExecution \n This synchronization is a contention point and introduces a \n dead lock for recoverable execution . \n The ` updateTaskStatus ` method only alters the ` failedTasks ` and \n ` finishedTasks ` variables . \n The ` failedTasks ` list is only used to check whether there are too \n many tasks failed , and whether the next recovery is possible . It \n is always updated and checked within the same method . Thus , \n synchronization is not needed , as long as the ` failedTasks ` set is \n concurrent ( allows concurrent modifications ) . \n The ` finishedTasks ` is used to check whether the stage execution is \n done . It is updated only withing the ` updateTaskStatus ` , and it is \n checked in 2 different places . The ` updateTaskStatus ` and the \n ` schedulingComplete ` . As long as the ` finishedTasks ` allows concurrent \n modifications itself the overall lock is not needed . As : \n - In the ` schedulingComplete ` : \n ` transitionToScheduled ` always happens before the \n ` finishedTasks . size ( ) = = allTasks . size ( ) ` \n - In the ` updateTaskStatus ` : \n ` finishedTasks . add ( taskStatus . getTaskId ( ) ) ` always happens before \n the ` stageExecutionState = = StageExecutionState .

Fix decimal division \n Remainder may overflow , thus the unsigned division must be done .
Produce Hive splittable bucketed splits \n This is the fix for the regression allegedly introduced by the 67ce2ed
Improve error message when $ bucket column is not available
Always keep bucketed execution on for temporary tables \n Make session property ignore _ table _ bucketing only applicable for \n source tables but not intermediate tables . \n Temporary tables are created bucketed explicitly by the engine request . \n There virtually no use case when temporary table bucketing should be ignored , \n as ignoring bucketing for the temporary table breaks the materialized execution . \n It might be useful to be able to ignore bucketing of the input table without \n implicitly breaking the materializing execution .
Encode PlanFragmentId as string in JSON \n The " Create stage id based on the plan fragment id " commit changed the \n way the PlanFragmentId is encoded in JSON : \n https : / / github . com / prestodb / presto / commit / 326f80539e42847dd9292d7847da4df8a331a55e \n Before this patch the value had been encoded as a String , and after \n this patch the PlanFragmentId started to be encoded as a number . \n This breaks the " Live Plan " UI , as the " Live Plan " controller doesn ' t \n match the remote source ids that are still encoded as strings \n ( see JsonRenderedNode ) : \n https : / / github . com / prestodb / presto / blob / master / presto - main / src / main / java / com / facebook / presto / sql / planner / planPrinter / JsonRenderer . java # L53 \n https : / / github . com / prestodb / presto / blob / master / presto - main / src / main / java / com / facebook / presto / sql / planner / planPrinter / JsonRenderer . java # L64 \n https : / / github . com / prestodb / presto / blob / master / presto - main / src / main / resources / webapp / src / components / LivePlan . jsx # L238 \n An alternative solution is to encode JsonRenderedNode # remoteSources \n as a number as well . However , since all other ids ( PlanNodeId , StageId ) \n are encoded as a string , it seems to be more convenient to also have \n the PlanFragmentId encoded as a string .
Make require Hadoop native configurable \n On some operation systems ( e . g . : Alpine Linux ) native Hadoop libraries \n cannot be loaded

Add exponential decay config to failure detector \n Make the exponential decay for failure detector , so we can configure it \n to make the recoverable exocution tests more stable
Enforce broadcast memory limits in Presto on Spark
Run presto spark tests in forked VM \n The tests no longer use stream redirects thus the workaround is \n no longer needed .
Do not run docker based spark integration tests by default
Increase test runner heap size \n Lately we ' ve been observing high GC pressure when running unit and \n integration tests . Increasing heap size is supposed to mitigate this issue . \n Travis machines are equipped with 7 . 5GB of memory , thus the increase \n from 2GB to 4GB should be fine .
Create normal block with all null positions in createAllNullsBlock \n It is somehow not intuitive that the createAllNullsBlock creates an \n RLE block . If the RLE block of a null value is needed - it feels like \n there should be an explicit method that does that .
Refactor RemoteSourceFactory \n Pass list of types as a parameter
Make sure spark service is created only once \n If VM is recycled it is possible to reuse Presto service . \n Generally it is not expected for a VM to be reused between different queries . \n If ( for some strange reason ) VM is reused between queries , and the Presto \n package or configuration is different for these queries - we prefer to fail \n instead of keep creating Presto services . Immediate failure is preferred to \n avoid hidden liveness issues ( such as memory leaks , etc . )
Remove dependencies from the shaded presto - launcher pom \n Shaded artifacts includes a copy of the dependency libraries classes . \n The dependency declarations have to be removed from the generated \n artifact pom . Otherwise when dependencies are included - classes \n are going to be double - included in the project that uses a shaded \n jar as a dependency . \n Unfortunately there is no way of generating a separate , reduced dependency \n pom file for only a " shaded " classified artifact , thus the main artifact \n has to be replaced with a shaded one .
Reduce presto - spark - classloader - interface scope in presto - spark - base \n The presto - spark - classloader - interface classes are expected to be provided \n by the launcher classloader .
Remove unnecessary maven - shade - plugin run from presto - spark - base
Wait for final task info on abort \n Wait for final task info on abort to avoid missing task statistics in \n case when query finishes before the final task info is received by the \n TaskInfoFetcher .
Remove overrides for idle connection timeout \n The override was added when the idle timeout was low in the HttpClient \n configuration . Now the default is 1m , thus it is even higher than the \n specified 30s timeout .
Do not cancel running HTTP requests \n Canceling a running HTTP request when using HTTP / 1 closes underlying \n connection decreasing the pooling efficiency . It is also possible to \n run out of ports ff the connections are closed and reopened too \n frequently .
Update spark - core to 2 . 0 . 2 - 6 \n The new version contains non relocated kryo classes
Fix PrestoSparkRowBuffer synchronization \n Otherwise newly added row can be pulled out of buffer \n even before the memory context is updated resulting in assertion \n failures in memory context as overall memory utilization can become \n negative
Invoke spark - submit directly \n This is more flexible
Disable force single node output for Presto on Spark \n There ' s no need for another round of collect , as the results are always collected \n on the driver
Reduce spark integration tests memory footprint \n To prevent Travis from failing intermittently

Fix flaky TestFileSingleStreamSpiller \n The test was sporadically failing at \n > assertEquals ( listFiles ( spillPath . toPath ( ) ) . size ( ) , 0 ) ; \n The assertion verifies that the spiller does the cleanup on close . \n Since the test is not single threaded , test methods are allowed to \n run in parallel . Thus it is not correct to write to a single shared \n folder . Instead each test method has to write to it ' s own folder to \n guarantee that the folder will be empty after the cleanup .
Fix PrestoSparkOutputOperator \n In case of 0 columns row the output can be empty . Empty output \n does not contain byte array .
Run presto - spark - base tests in a separate travis job
Fix hostname related assertion failure in PrestoSparkQueryRunner \n If the local hostname is not set in the system , the PrestoSparkQueryRunner \n fails with the " java . lang . AssertionError : assertion failed : Expected hostname " . \n Following the workaround described in the issue : \n https : / / issues . apache . org / jira / browse / SPARK - 19394 ? focusedCommentId = 15846109
Check requirements under try - catch \n To make sure that query events are generated
Move Presto Spark execution exceptions to presto - spark - classloader - interface \n As they have to be serializable
Prefer default parallelism to avoid adding extra local exchange \n For partitioned writes the shuffle is added unconditionally . There ' s \n no reason to additionally prefer the fixed streams .

Enable reading from the remote build cache for all \n Previously , the remote build cache was only enabled if the \n GRADLE _ ENTERPRISE _ URL environment variable was configured . This meant \n that contributors would not benefit from the build time improvements \n of the caching without some additional setup . \n This commit updates the buildCache configuration so that reading from \n the remote build cache at https : / / ge . spring . io is enabled for all . \n Pushing to the cache continues to be disabled unless the required \n credentials are provided . Build scan configuration has also been \n updated in line with this change . While the server URL is now \n hardcoded , publishing is still opt - in via an environment variable . \n The exact mechanism by which someone can opt in will change in the \n future once some server - side changes have been made . At this point , \n only a change to publishAlwaysIf should be necessary . \n Closes gh - 24105
Upgrade to Asciidoctor Gradle Plugin 2 . 4 \n This commit updates the build to use the latest version of the \n Asciidoctor Gradle Plugin . One significant new feature is that the \n plugin ' s tasks are now cacheable . \n Closes gh - 24216
Always configure PDF backend as task will only run on cache miss \n Previously , the Asciidoctor task was not cacheable and generating the \n PDF documentation was very slow . To improve build times , the PDF \n documentation was not generated for snapshot builds . \n The upgrade to 2 . 4 . 0 of the Asciidoctor Gradle pluging means that the \n Asciidoctor task is now cacheable . As such , its tasks will only run \n when the documentation has changed . This should allow PDF \n documentation to be published for every build without slowing things \n down too much and the cost of generating the documentation will only \n be incurred when there is a change to the documentation . \n See gh - 24216
Only change the method of requests that Jetty won ' t handle by default \n Previously , JettyEmbeddedErrorHandler would change the method of every \n request that is handles to GET . This was being done to work around \n Jetty ' s error handling only dealing with GET , POST , and HEAD requests \n by default . It had the unwanted side - effect of causing an error \n response to a HEAD request having a body as , from the error handling ' s \n perspective , it was a GET request . \n This commit updates JettyEmbeddedErrorHandler to only set the method \n on a request for which error handling is being performed if the method \n isn ' t already one that will be handled , leaving the method of GET , \n POST , and HEAD requests unchanged . \n Unfortunately , short of implementing an HTTP client , this change cannot \n be tested as the Apache HttpClient , OkHttp , and the JDK ' s \n HttpURLConnection all silently drop the body of a response to a HEAD \n request , preventing a test from asserting that a body hasn ' t been sent . \n Closes gh - 23551
Publish a build scan only if authenticated \n Previously , anyone could publish a scan and publishing was performed \n if the GRADLE _ ENTERPRISE _ URL environment variable was set . \n ge . spring . io has now been locked down to prohibit anonymous build scan \n publishing . This commit aligns with this change by only attempting to \n publish a build scan when authenticated with the server . \n Authentication is achieved via an access token that is made available \n via an environment variable on CI and locally via a file in ~ / . gradle . \n One can obtain an access key by running the following command : \n . / gradlew provisionGradleEnterpriseAccessKey \n Closes gh - 24371

Ignore resolution of copied configuration \n When a Configuration is copied , any before and after resolve actions \n that are registered with its ResolvableDependencies are also copied \n over . This means that , when a copied configuration is resolved the \n resolution actions may be called on a ResolvableDependencies instances \n that isn ' t the one to which they were added . \n Previously , the above - described Gradle behaviour would result in \n BootJar accessed the ResolvedConfiguration of a Configuration that may \n not have yet been resolved . At best this would trigger Configuration \n resolution and at worst it would fail . A failure could occur if the \n configuration had been copied so that it could be made resolvable . \n The afterResolve action would then try to access the \n ResolvedConfiguration of the original Configuration . This would trigger \n a resolution attempt that fails due to the original configuration being \n marked as unresolvable . \n This commit updates the afterResolve action in BootJar to check that \n the ResolvableDependencies with which it is called matches the \n ResolvableDependencies with which it was original registered . Only \n when the two match , and therefore the configuration has actually been \n resolved , does processing proceed . \n Fixes gh - 24072

This ensures that the hook is available \n to clean up the context if the JVM is shutdown while refresh is in \n progress . \n Fixes gh - 23625

Await registration of http . server . requests meter \n Previously , the test would make an HTTP request and , as soon as the \n response was received , it would check the presence and value of the \n http . server . requests meter . This create a race condition between the \n meter being registered once the response had been flushed and the \n meter ' s presence being checked . If the check won the race , the test \n would fail . \n This commit updates the test to wait for up to 5 seconds for the \n meter to be present and have a count of 1 , matching the single request \n that has been made . \n Fixes gh - 23919

Only attempt unwrapping of interfaces \n Wrapper ' s isWrapperFor and unwrap methods both take a Class < ? > target \n but document that the target should be an interface .

Allow restart to be enabled when CL not named AppClassLoader \n Previously , the restart initializer that enables restart when \n - Dspring . devtools . restart . enabled = true is set had no effect when the \n ClassLoader ' s name did not contain AppClassLoader . This commit updates \n RestartApplicationListener to use the correct RestartInitializer when \n the system property has forcibly enabled restart . \n When restart is enabled a SilentExitException is thrown and it should be \n caught and handled by the SilentExitExceptionHandler . When the \n application is invoked via one of the loader ' s LauncherClasses \n reflection is used and this exception becomes wrapped in an \n InvocationTargetEception . Previously , this wrapping prevented \n SilentExitExceptionHandler from handling the exception . This commit \n updates the handler to look for an InvocationTargetException with a \n SilentExitException target in addition to continuing to look for a \n SilentExitException directly . \n Fixes gh - 24797

Check configured JavaLauncher when determining version of the JVM \n Previously , bootRun assumed that the Java version of the JVM that would \n run the application would be the same as the Java version of the JVM \n that is running the build . This assumption does not hold true when \n Gradle ' s toolchain support is used to configure tasks that fork a new \n JVM to use a version other than that being used by Gradle itself . \n This commit updates the BootRun task to query the JavaLauncher property \n when determining the version of Java on which the application will be \n run . Toolchain support and the JavaLauncher property are new in Gradle \n 6 . 7 . To support earlier versions of Gradle , NoSuchMethodError is caught \n we continue as if no JavaLauncher has been configured and use the local \n JVM ' s Java version . \n Fixes gh - 24512
Configure bootRun to use project ' s Java toolchain by default \n Previously , unlike the application plugin ' s run task , our bootRun task \n ignored the project ' s Java toolchain . This meant that the application \n was run on a JVM with the same Java version as the one being used by \n Gradle itself . This could result in a failure if the application \n required a more modern JVM . \n This commit updates the plugin to configure the bootRun task ' s \n JavaLauncher convention to be one derived from the project ' s Java \n toolchain . Toolchain support was introduced in Gradle 6 . 7 so this is \n only done when using Gradle 6 . 7 and later . \n Fixes gh - 24517

Fixed layout \n And eliminated unnecessary new String { . . }
Added different implementation for Null Sorter test \n Added an extra test case providing an alternative implementation for \n the getMethodsNullSorter test case . \n The new implementation passes when coverage analysis using jacoco is \n enabled , whereas the old one incorrectly fails . \n The new approach only checks the order of methods that are of interest \n ( i . e . , not looking at irrelevant extra methods that the coverage \n analyzer might generate ) . \n Furthermore the new approach avoid the ' sensitive equality ' test smell \n by replacing toString - based equality by actual equality .

Fix NPE in ILMHistoryStore TRACE Loggging ( # 65651 ) \n We can ' t access thebulk request items after the bulk request was executed \n because we ` null ` them out . This code would always throw an NPE therefore \n and now started to trip assertions due to # 65415 .
Deduplicate Index Meta Generations when Deserializing ( # 65619 ) \n These strings are quite long individually and will be repeated \n potentially up to the number of snapshots in the repository times . \n Since these make up more than half of the size of the repository metadata \n and are likely the same for all snapshots the savings from deduplicating them \n can make up for more than half the size of ` RepositoryData ` easily in most real - world \n cases .

Fix Needless WARN Logging during Snapshot ABORT ( # 65077 ) \n The fact that we run into ` ABORTED ` when moving from ` INIT ` to ` STARTED ` is not a bug \n since during a snapshot abort we might have concurrently moved the status to ` ABORTED ` \n due to a cluster state update . In this case we should throw ` AbortedSnapshotException ` \n so that upstream logic will avoid logging a warning for this expected exception .
Fix testSnapshotCanceledOnRemovedShard ( # 65096 ) \n This test failed a couple of times recently when master CS application was slow . \n This is explained by the data node blocking before the master even gets around to applying \n the cluster state that contains the started snapshot , leading to all the logic around \n failing the shard to run too early . \n Also we shouldn ' t just fire off the create snapshot response in the background without making \n sure that it actually returns ( otherwise we may leak the in - progress snapshot for a tiny window of time \n when it was physically written to the repo but not yet removed from the cluster state and fail the repo \n cleanup after the test ) .
Remove Redundant use of Cancellable Threads in PeerRecoveryTargetService ( # 65119 ) \n The transport request sending call is completely async and never throws at this point \n ( all exceptions are caught and passed to the transport handler ) making this use of cancellable \n threads redundant .

Fix Broken Error Handling in CacheFile # acquire ( # 65342 ) \n If we fail to create the ` FileChannelReference ` ( e . g . because the directory it should be created in \n was deleted in a test ) we have to remove the listener from the ` listeners ` set to not trip internal \n consistency assertions . \n Relates # 65302 ( does not fix it though , but reduces noise from failures by removing secondary \n tripped assertions after the test fails )
Default S3 Chunk Size to 5TB ( # 64980 ) \n Just like we did for Azure and GCS we should just go with the \n maximum possible chunk size in S3 as well .
Adjust Cleanup Order of Internal State in SnapshotsService ( # 66225 ) \n In the assertion mentioned in the new comment we first get the ` endingSnapshots ` \n and then check that we don ' t have a listener that isn ' t referred to by it so we need \n to remove from the listers map before removing from ` endingSnapshots ` to avoid rare , random \n assertion tripping here with concurrent repository operations .
Fix SearchableSnapshotRelocationIntegTests ( # 66234 ) \n We must only check he running relocations here . Otherwise , \n a cache that is randomly sized too small for the prewarm on the \n initial primary will show up as another recovery ( because it ' ll be stuck on ` FINALIZE ` ) \n and break the assertions around only having a single recovery running .
Remove Lucene Precommit from PersistentCache ( # 66324 ) \n There is nothing gained from doing the precommit step explicitly here . \n Also , we can just reuse the same map entries statically .
Fix SearchableSnapshot Relocation Test ( # 66322 ) \n Follow - up to # 66234 to also handle the case where the relocation target can ' t hold \n the full shard in its cache and gets stuck in ` FINALIZE ` for the relocation recovery \n entry .
Improve Error Handling in SearchableSnapshotAllocator ( # 66402 ) \n 1 . We shouldn ' t be triggering reroutes when we don ' t have all \n the data yet \n 2 . We must handle failure responses , otherwise we never trigger the reroute .

Fix NPE in Cloning Snapshots that Include Datastreams ( # 67642 ) \n Fix ` Metadata ` by removing datastreams that are missing \n indices from the snapshot .
Make RepositoryData Parsing Stricter ( # 67699 ) \n We should not accept random bytes after the actual repository \n data bytes . Not validating for this was causing e . g . ` { } abc ` to be parsed \n as empty repository data instead of throwing . \n closes # 67696
Remove Recovery Chunk Size G1GC Workaround ( # 67348 ) \n We don ' t allocate new arrays for each chunk any longer ( see # 65921 ) \n so this workaround can go away ( if anything it now makes allignment a little worse ) .
Fix Rare Race in Repository Generation Initialization ( # 67713 ) \n Fixes extreme corner case in repository initialization .
Don ' t Deduplicate RepositoryData Loading When Caching is Disabled ( # 68126 ) \n Deduplicating repository data loading when deactivating caching ( which is effectively a test only \n setting that allows us to change the repo data at a given generation in place ) . \n In the corner case of the result deduplicator not removing the request from the ` requests ` map \n quickly enough when we update the repository data in place this causes the old version to be loaded still , \n thus breaking repo corruption tests . \n Instead of complicating the tests , this commit just turns off deduplication if caching is off since \n its always on in production anyway . \n Closes # 67696
Properly Retain Buffer in RecoverySourceHandler ( # 68283 ) \n This only really applies to tests using the ` AsyncRecoveryTarget ` as far as I can see but \n be that as it may , we should properly handle the ref count on the content here and only \n release the buffer once it ' s released and not tie the bytes to the listener lifecycle . \n Otherwise the bytes can ' t be retained by the multi file writer when dealing with out of order \n writes and get released to early . \n Closes # 68280
Fix Partial Restore Of Snapshot Including DataStream ( # 68365 ) \n We have to filter the intermediate metadata here so that indices \n and datastreams in it are consistent . Otherwise we throw an NPE \n in production when restoring global state but not all datastreams \n and trip an assertion in tests . \n Closes # 68357

Fix BlobStoreRepositoryCleanupIT Leaking Futures ( # 69446 ) \n The problem with # 69434 was that during master failover \n the listener might get retried after the new master has \n already dropped the cleanup from the cluster state which \n then conflicts with the cleanup executed by the repo consistency \n checks after each test . \n To prevent running into this conflict , just wait for the future \n to actually return . \n Closes # 69434
Correctly Wait for Cluster State Recovery in Encrypted Repo Test ( # 69547 ) \n Waiting for a connected cluster is not enough , we must wait for green to ensure \n that state recovery has happened which causes the repository to be created . \n Closes # 67834
Add Ref Count Assertion to Page ( # 69599 ) \n Added this assertion to have an easier time debugging \n work on # 67502 and found that we were accessing ` refcount = = 0 ` \n bytes in the ` SSLOutboundBuffer ` so I fixed that buffer to not \n keep references to released pages .
Fix Threading in Snapshot Restore ( # 68390 ) \n Same as # 68023 but even less likely ( couldn ' t really find a quick way \n to write a test for it for that reason ) . \n Fix is the same , fork off to the generic pool for listener handling . \n Also , this allows removing the forking in the transport action since we don ' t do any long \n runnning work on the calling thread any longer in the restore method .
Fix BlobStoreRepositoryTest Leaking a RepoData Write Operation ( # 68441 ) \n We were leaking a repo data write operation here by never waiting on the future . \n Since we normally don ' t invoke ` writeIndexGen ` manually there are no safety measures \n around removing the repository from the cluster state and adding it back with a different \n path concurrently , leading to a collision between repo generation CS updates since all tests \n use the same repository name . \n Fix the missing write and added some trace logging that was very helpful in tracking this down . \n Closes # 68437
Safer Refresh of Index Stats in CCR IT ( # 66830 ) \n We should only force merge after we know that an index is green and refresh after \n forcemerge to ensure we get the latest stats in any case . \n closes # 64167
Fix S3ClientSettings Class Loading ( # 66886 ) \n This is motivated by the inability to run \n ` org . elasticsearch . repositories . encrypted . EncryptedS3BlobStoreRepositoryIntegTests ` \n in isolation without this workaround . The way integration tests load classes \n otherwise leads to a load order which doesn ' t load the plugin class first , \n thus fails to apply the jackson workaround before further S3 classes are loaded \n but depend on our Jackson workaround .
Fix AutoFollowIT Failures from Transport Thread Assertion ( # 67115 ) \n We have to execute the failure callback on the generic pool as well , \n not just the ` onResponse ` since it blocks on a transport request so I refactored \n the listener accordingly . \n closes # 67106
Fix off by one Mistake in SparseFileTrackerTests ( # 68739 ) \n This was caused by # 68709 which turned the edge case of a \n range with start > end into a tripped assertion .

Add support for providing a custom layout during logging bootstrap \n Dropwizard users have the ability to configure their application to \n use JSON as the logging format . Unfortunately , the default logging \n bootstrap mechanism which kicks off before Dropwizard logging \n configuration , uses the default logging layout . As a result , some \n internal logging messages ( Jetty , Hibernate initialization ) are \n produced in a not recognized format . \n This change add possibility to specify a layout factory during \n the bootstrap process . Users can override the bootstrap method of \n ` Application ` and provide an own layout format . For example , \n ` ` ` \n BootstrapLogging . bootstrap ( Level . INFO , new EventJsonLayoutBaseFactory ( ) ) ; \n ` ` ` \n As a result , the all applications logs will produced in the JSON format .
Remove JSON logs from the dropwizard - example \n It ' s most certainly a feature for advanced users , not for an example \n project .
Upgrade handling an unknown value in FuzzyEnumModule \n Since Jackson 2 . 9 , the ` mappingException ` method has been deprecated \n in favour of more specific methods . Therefore , we should use \n ` weirdStringException ` for our case when we can ' t map a string value \n to a an enum value .
Simpley a builder for configuration parsing errors \n Remove the snakeyaml Mark API which has been deprecated in Jackson \n since 2 . 8 and isn ' t used in Dropwizard anymore .
Try to fix problems with deploying snapshots to Sonatype OSS repo \n We use HTTP and the the build fails from time to time . Sonatype \n automatically redirects traffic to HTTPS , so it may cause \n problems for the client , because it has to perform 2 HTTP \n requests . Let ' s try to use HTTPS straight away .
Upgrade Jadira to 7 . 0 . 0 - rc1 \n There has been a new release of Jadira which supports running under \n JDK 9 . That means we can remove a dependency on my fork via jitpack . \n This new release also now picks up the database timezone from the \n ` hibernate . jdbc . time _ zone ` property , so we should specify it in our \n tests , otherwise Hibernates reads timestamps in the host ' s timezone .

Have DefaultDatabaseProvider return filename \n The API for ` DatabaseProvider ` is to return ` List < File > ` however the \n current implementation of ` DefaultDatabaseProvider ` returns a ` File ` \n that does not exist .

Version 1 . 0 . 4 - SNAPSHOT
Version 1 . 1 . 0 \n Changes to default metrics publishing behavior are significant enough to warrant a bump from 1 . 0 . x to 1 . 1 . x
New submodule hystrix - metrics - event - stream
Removing a method that wasn ' t working and shouldn ' t be there .
Removing arguments that aren ' t needed by HystrixCommandMetrics

Change logger from info to debug for property changes
href target so it opens from javadoc frame
Documenting a RuntimeException thrown if shardRequests is used incorrectly . \n Not casting when the method call is against the interface .
Use logger . error not logger . debug for fallback failure \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 12 \n Removed duplicate fallback handling code by making the timeout path use the common getFallbackOrThrowException method . \n By doing so it also uses the standard path which uses logger . error for a fallback failure .
Default Collapser scope to REQUEST if using Setter \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 22
Initialize HealthCounts to non - null value . \n In a stress test I was doing that pounds a circuit immediately after creation it would have thread contention on the compareAndSet , one thread would go to create it , the other ( s ) would go to the else and return null and cause an NPE when trying to use it . \n The losing threads should get the originally initialized value set to 0 .

Simplified access to HystrixCommandMetrics \n Instead of requiring all access to go " over the top " via Servo or some other published mechanism allow simpler direct access to the metrics object .
Simplified access to HystrixCommandMetrics \n Instead of requiring all access to go " over the top " via Servo or some other published mechanism allow simpler direct access to the metrics object .
Fixing non - deterministic unit test \n Intermittent failures have been occurring where command executions succeed when they ' re supposed to timeout . \n Increasing the time the thread sleeps so thread scheduling has less chance to affect this .
Cleaner design by injecting listener into constructor . \n Since start / pause can be called multiple times it shouldn ' t have the listener passed into start ( )
Make javax . servlet - api a ' provided ' dependency for compilation but not transitive . \n Trying to make it so it doesn ' t force a servlet version or a specific jar . Nothing about the implementation requires anything higher than Servlet 2 . x .

RequestLog : Reduce Chance of Memory Leak \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 53
Fix getCurrentConcurrentExecutionCount value \n - correctly increment / decrement ( was just setting at beginning of request before ) \n - work for both semaphore and thread isolation
Better error message on run ( ) method failure .
BugFix : Race condition between run ( ) and timeout \n This uses compareAndSet to synchronize timeout vs run ( ) completion logic when there is a race . \n I have not been able to to replicate the issue reported at https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 188 but I can see how the existing code is vulnerable to a race condition . This theoretically should fix it . All unit tests pass for existing functionality . All my attempts to create a unit test to reveal the issue failed .
Protecting against timeout race - condition for error handling .
handle null circuit breaker \n This can be caused by a HystrixCommand disabling the circuit breaker .
UnitTest for Checked Exceptions \n Adding a unit test for behavior added in https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / pull / 64 and discussed in https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 63
Migrate from junit to junit - dep without hamcrest

stop using HystrixCollapser / reset - collapser \n See https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / pull / 106 and https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 102
Remove TODOs made invalid by HystrixPlugin changes \n Plugins can not be modified after registration so caching is okay .
Change Throwable to Exception \n Generally not good practice to be catching Throwable so changing to Exception .
Implement destroy ( ) method for graceful shutdown of MetricsStreamServlet
Fix NoSuchElementException in Hystrix . endCurrentThreadExecutingCommand \n If a semaphore isolated HystrixCommand gets a response from a request cache this exception will be thrown : \n Caused by : java . util . NoSuchElementException \n at java . util . LinkedList . removeFirst ( LinkedList . java : 268 ) \n at java . util . LinkedList . pop ( LinkedList . java : 799 ) \n at com . netflix . hystrix . Hystrix . endCurrentThreadExecutingCommand ( Hystrix . java : 88 ) \n at com . netflix . hystrix . HystrixCommand . queueInSemaphore ( HystrixCommand . java : 647 ) \n at com . netflix . hystrix . HystrixCommand . queue ( HystrixCommand . java : 551 ) \n at com . netflix . platform . dependencycommand . NFDependencyCommand . queue ( NFDependencyCommand . java : 346 )
ExecutionHook : Change onSuccess to onComplete \n I think onComplete is clearer since the response can be either from run ( ) or getFallback ( )
Limit scope of CurrentThreadExecutingCommand \n This is a tweak to : https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 116 \n It should only start / stop on immediate sides of executeCommand ( ) being invoked .
Remove ' final ' modifiers to allow mocking \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 96
Upgrade to RxJava 0 . 8 . 4 \n - pick up concurrency fix to ScheduledObserver https : / / github . com / Netflix / RxJava / pull / 269
Ordering of log now records in order of execution , not completion
Fix non - deterministic test \n - it is relying on scheduling of the collapser timer \n - this is an example so specifically should not be refactored to use artifical time
Change IDEA config to use COMPILE instead of PROVIDED \n - running individual unit tests after a full run has issues when they are marked as PROVIDED due to how the classpaths are set
Fix NPE if Hystrix . reset ( ) called when it ' s already shutdown \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 124
Fix concurrency bug in RequestBatch for HystrixCollapser \n A short - cut return was before the try / finally . With thread interleaving one thread could get the readLock and never release it and then the execute / shutdown methods would block indefinitely trying to get the writeBlock . \n I don ' t know for sure that this was the bug I ' ve been hunting but the symptoms that could occur from this exactly match what happened .
Reduce logging \n - change logger . error to logger . debug on noisy logs \n - improve wording on message where a command has failed and the fallback failed \n - logger . error is not needed since everywhere that it would be valuable throws a HystrixRuntimeException which will be handled or logged elsewhere
Assert that cancelling / unsubscribing a single collapsed request doesn ' t cancel batch
IllegalStateException on duplicate invocation . \n - added Javadoc to formalize this contract ( it was always there ) \n - reverted back to 1 . 2 behavior where IllegalStateException is thrown directly , not wrapped inside a HystrixRuntimeException
Improve exception javadoc for observer / toObservable methods .
Fix regex so it includes more than one digit \n This may be the cause of many CloudBees test failures as execution times longer than single - digit milliseconds are occurring .
Include more info when collapsed requests remain in queue \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 78
IllegalStateException : Future Not Started \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 80 \n Adding much more detail exception message to help in debugging this when it happens as it shouldn ' t ever happen .
ThreadPool stream should include reportingHosts \n https : / / github . com / Netflix / Hystrix / issues / 82
GitAttributes for Line Endings \n https : / / help . github . com / articles / dealing - with - line - endings \n See https : / / github . com / Netflix / RxJava / issues / 579
Fix Exception vs Throwable typo \n - This was using the Object overload rather than statically typed Func1 < Throwable > method . This was caught when testing RxJava 0 . 11 . 0 which restores static type safety .

Alias from switchOnNext to switchLatest to match RxJS \n - keeping onNext to be locally consistent with doOnNext
Fix TakeLast after removing SingleAssignmentSubscription \n - SingleAssignmentSubscription was removed in one merge , TakeLast modified in another merge .
Deprecate manWithIndex \n If we leave mapWithIndex then we should have “withIndex” on many other operators . Instead of this , an Observable should just be zipped with an infinite stream of numbers and the zip function provides the index . \n This keeps the API surface area smaller and provides the desired behavior on all operators .
Deprecate aggregate in favor of reduce \n We have had aggregate from Rx . Net for a while but long ago migrated to reduce as the primary . Time to deprecate it .
Remove Extra Synchronization \n The use of flatMap / mergeMap already synchronizes .
Standardize Naming of average / sum methods \n See https : / / github . com / Netflix / RxJava / pull / 698 # issuecomment - 31282416
Manual Merge of Pull # 616 \n Manual merge of https : / / github . com / Netflix / RxJava / pull / 616 \n - remove use of SingleAssignmentSubscription \n - suppress warnings
Fix Memory Leak in NewThreadScheduler Recursion \n - the Action0 method did not have a leak \n - the Func2 method on inner scheduler recursion did have a leak
Small ObserveOn Improvements \n - use Long instead of Int so we don’t overflow \n - migrate from deprecated method
Fix CurrentThreadScheduler Delay Bug \n - introduced a bug during refactor , caught it while updating unit tests
Increasing Unit Test Timeout for Slow Machines \n - Increasing timeout by a lot to handle slow machines such as this : https : / / netflixoss . ci . cloudbees . com / job / RxJava - pull - requests / 629 / testReport / junit / rx . schedulers / ExecutorSchedulerTests / recursionUsingFunc2 / \n - The timeout is only there if a deadlock or memory leak occurs ( which is what this PR is fixing ) so when everything is healthy it does not timeout
Remove Validation of Ordering \n - this test does a flatMap which uses merge which has non - deterministic ordering since the Observable . from can be on a new thread each time
Use latches instead of sleep for unit test \n As per suggestion at https : / / github . com / benjchristensen / RxJava / commit / 5b317ad827f624bed6cbf5f2e04df050ebbe01d0 # commitcomment - 5839773

Fix OperationalConditional \n All unit tests now pass .
Comment on Parallel \n - the previously performed observeOn changes appear to have resolved the non - determinism
Fix Unit Tests related to SubscribeOn \n - timeout test could be interrupted when unsubscribed \n - groupBy . subscribeOn needs blocking buffer
Scheduler . scheduleRecursive \n Make recursive scheduling a first - class citizen without needing to refer to " this " which doesn ' t work inside lambdas ( Java8 / Scala / etc ) . \n Schedulers . newThread ( ) . scheduleRecursive ( new Action1 < Recurse > ( ) { \n @ Override \n public void call ( Recurse r ) { \n System . out . println ( " do stuff on thread : " + Thread . currentThread ( ) + " Time : " + System . nanoTime ( ) ) ; \n r . schedule ( 100 , TimeUnit . MILLISECONDS ) ; \n } \n } ) ;
Fixed Unit Test : Subscription Behavior Changed \n RxJava 0 . 17 handles synchronous Subscriptions now so this code needed to be changed otherwise the exceptions never got thrown since the isUnsubscribed ( ) would already be true .
Fixed Unit Test : Class Names \n Deriving the full class names for these inner classes was being done wrong and resulted in bad class names when the unit tests got moved .
Remove Bad Filter Logic \n This code was accidentally committed during exploration of groupBy / subscribeOn .

Remove groupBy with selector . \n Use groupBy . map instead .
Deprecate Direct Access to Scheduler Implementations \n This enforces the convention of using ` Schedulers . * ` and then makes the RxJavaDefaultSchedulers plugin more reliable .
RxJava 0 . 17 . 0 - RC3
Operator : doOnTerminate \n Like finallyDo but before emitting the terminal state instead of after .
Delete Deprecated onSubscribeStart That Doesn ' t Work \n - It ' s messy to make this work so deleting it instead . \n - Better to move forward in the 0 . 17 release than try and make this work for the very small percentage ( probably only Netflix ) that uses it .
RxJava 0 . 17 . 0 - RC4
And another debug println . . . \n Whoops .
TimeoutObservable - > HystrixObservableTimeoutOperator \n - Use " Operator " name as that ' s what it is . \n - Use HystrixObservableTimeoutOperator instead of TimeoutOperator so in a stacktrace it ' s clear it ' s the Hystrix variant and not the normal RxJava TimeoutOperator .

Upgrade to JMH 0 . 7 . 3
Change ` void accept ` to ` boolean accept ` \n As per a change @ akarnokd did elsewhere with ` accept2 ` method .
Remove Bad Perf Test \n - this just stresses scheduling and at this throughput creates massive garbage and tests the wrong thing
Deprecate multiple arity ‘from’ \n - added @ Deprecated annotations where it was only part of the Javadoc \n - deprecated ‘where’ which is a duplicate of ` filter ` kept from early days matching Rx . Net
Simpler computation / io naming for Schedulers \n - simpler ( no one remembers the current names when talking about them ) \n - does not tie naming to a particular implementation involving thread pools versus a pool of event loops or something similar ( as we likely will change the implementation , see https : / / github . com / Netflix / RxJava / issues / 713 )
Return wrapped Subscription \n - make sure the SafeSubscriber is included in what is returned \n - then return as Subscription not Subscriber so it can ' t be cast back to a Subscriber
Take operator was breaking the unsubscribe chain \n Fixes issue https : / / github . com / Netflix / RxJava / issues / 830
Make Parallel use NewThread until Computation Fixed \n See https : / / github . com / Netflix / RxJava / issues / 713 \n It was causing non - deterministic behavior , random test failures and poor performance .
GroupBy Test Improvement \n ObserveOn was the wrong mechanism for delaying behavior as it was relying on the buffering of observeOn . \n Now using delay ( ) to delay the group since observeOn no longer buffers .
Changed to use SubscribeOn instead of ObserveOn for Async Behavior \n The ObserveOn operator is for moving where it executes , not making it async . SubscribeOn makes it async .

Fix TrampolineScheduler NullPointerException \n I tried for about 30 minutes to replicate the NPE reported in https : / / github . com / ReactiveX / RxJava / issues / 1702 but couldn ' t . \n It makes sense reading the code that an unsubscribe could trigger an NPE though so I ' m fixing it as per recommendation of @ DylanSale even though I can ' t replicate . \n I confirmed that the items are being put in the queue BEFORE the wip variable is incremented , so that concurrency seems okay .
Remove use of ThreadLocal \n This was an awkward leftover from early version of RxJava ( pre v0 . 17 ) .
Fix Slow Non - deterministic Test \n Somehow I missed the Thread . sleep to force the scenario so most of the time this test would run very slow ( or forever ) . \n I ' m surprised the unit tests passed before . . . just random luck on thread scheduling .

Windows : Make runfiles symlink tree actions depend on the runfiles artifacts . \n Windows distinguishes between symlinks to files and symlinks to directories . The \n code to create symlink trees on Windows thus inspects the targets of the links \n to learn what kind of symlink to make . Unfortunately , the symlinking code did \n not depend on the link targets actually being created . This race could lead to \n non - deterministic and non - functional symlink trees . \n Fix this problem by depending on runfiles artifacts in the SymtreeTreeAction \n when the host platform is Windows . \n It ' s certainly possible to avoid this os - dependent input dependency—by using \n in - memory Artifact state for the in - process implementation and extending the \n runfiles manifest format to indicate target type for build - runfiles - windows—but \n this commit is the most straightforward change that remediates the serious \n correctness issue represented by the previous state . \n This topic has a long history . When Windows runfiles trees were actually copies \n of artifacts , the " symlink " action obviously had to depend on the origin \n artifacts ( 41f4456ac2348bef66739194853a1ddadcbb887e ) . That code was removed in \n an interregnum period where runfiles trees weren ' t supported at all on Windows \n ( 0885abd851b17d19661dfbd5459a5b91feb45620 ) . However , the dependency was not \n added back when Windows symlinked runfiles trees support was finally added \n ( b592dbd46d5aae2977b11426850eecb89d94a6cb ) . \n Closes # 12018 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 330496487

Add new carrier config option for enabling SIP PUBLISH of RCS caps \n Adds a new carrier config option that will bring up / down the service \n connection to the vendor IMS stack . When down , we should not \n see the vendor IMS stack generate SIP PUBLISH requests to the network . \n This is so that we do not generate SIP PUBLISH requests on networks \n that do not support this functionality . \n Bug : 173115560 \n Test : atest CarrierConfigTests \n Merged - In : If9ab9836261afc2d6cebb959690d8b44b06a3dfe \n Change - Id : If9ab9836261afc2d6cebb959690d8b44b06a3dfe

Unpublish Gradle metadata \n See gh - 23503
Puslish Gradle metadata \n Closes gh - 23503
Avoid setting special Content - * response headers for Tomcat \n As of gh - 21783 , Spring WebFlux uses a ` TomcatHeadersAdapter ` \n implementation to directly address the native headers used by the \n server . \n In the case of Tomcat , " Content - Length " and " Content - Type " headers are \n processed separately and should not be added to the native headers map . \n This commit improves the ` HandlerAdapter ` implementation for Tomcat and \n removes those headers , if previously set in the map . The adapter \n already has a section that handles the Tomcat - specific calls for such \n headers . \n Fixes gh - 24361
Remove quality parameter from selected media type \n Prior to this commit , WebFlux application would keep the quality \n parameter from the " Accept " request header when selecting a media type \n for the response . It would then echo it back to the client . \n While strictly not wrong , this is unnecessary and can confuse HTTP \n clients . This commit aligns WebFlux ' s behavior with Spring MVC . \n Fixes gh - 24239
Remove unnecessary dependency on spring - orm \n Prior to this commit , spring - aspects would consider spring - orm as a \n module providing aspects , which is not the case ( anymore ) . \n This commit removes that dependency as a result . \n Fixes gh - 24491
Configure Reactor Netty quiet shutdown period in tests \n See gh - 24538
Upgrade Guava for API Diff plugin \n Fixes gh - 24606
Polish ConcurrentLruCache \n This commit improves the performance of the ` ConcurrentLruCache ` and \n applies a consistent style to the code : \n * separating read / write locks into different variables does not help \n performance , so this change is reverted \n * apply a consistent style for read / write locks and try / cactch calls \n * the reordering of recently used keys is only done when the cache is \n full \n Fixes gh - 24671
Do not cache multipart MIME types in cache \n Prior to this commmit , " mutipart / * " MIME types would be cached by the \n ` MimeTypeUtils ` LRU cache . Since those MIME types are likely to have \n random boundaries in them , they can waste space in the LRU cache . \n This is not improving things since we ' re parsing them anyway . \n This commit skips the caching step for all " multipart " MIME types . \n Fixes gh - 24767
Remove artifactory plugin from build \n As we ' re moving the build to Concourse CI , we don ' t need to use the \n Artifactory plugin anymore . Our build will publish the artifacts to a \n repository on the local filesystem and will push its content to \n Artifactory with the spring - io / artifactory - resource . \n This commit also adds the conditional configuration for publishing to a \n local repository . \n See gh - 22490
Skip SSL validation in send - email build task \n See gh - 22490
Remove BOM workaround \n Since Gradle 6 . 2 , the scope information is not published anymore with \n the BOM , so we don ' t need to manually remove it anymore
Temporarily remove email notifications from build \n See gh - 22490
Only run checks in pipelines with JDK variants \n This commit updates the build pipeline to only run the checks \n ( formatting and tests ) with the build when non - JDK8 variants are used \n for sanity checks . \n See gh - 22490
Run JDK variants builds once a day \n See gh - 22490
Upgrade to Gradle Enterprise 3 . 2 \n Also use the " io . spring . gradle - enterprise - conventions " plugin for \n configuring Gradle Enterprise Cache support .
Fix JDK variants jobs inputs \n The git repository input was missing . \n See gh - 22490
Add git repo as output for build tasks \n This is required for exporting the Gradle Build Scan URL to \n notifications . \n See gh - 22490
Fix Artifactory properties on published artifacts \n This commit fixes the file pattern for the published zip artifacts . \n Prior to this commit , the pattern was wrong and properties were not \n applied to the published archives , preventing them from being published \n automatically ( javadoc , reference documentation , schemas . . . ) . \n See gh - 22490
Ensure that build directory exists before writing \n This commit ensures that the build directory exists before writing the \n build scan URL to it . This is useful when the ` clean ` task is executed \n and the build folder is gone by the time the execution is done . \n See gh - 22490
Add JMH benchmark infrastructure \n Prior to this commit , the Spring Framework test suite would rely only on \n " Performance " tests associated with a specific CI build . As outlined in \n gh - 24830 , the way they ' re built and executed is not working well \n anymore . \n This commit introduces a new JMH benchmark infrastructure in the build . \n The goal here is not to run those benchmarks as part of a CI build , but \n rather provide a proper infrastructure for writing and locally running \n micro - benchmarks when working on specific optimizations . \n This commit adds and configures a Gradle JMH plugin to allow for JMH \n benchmark classes in Spring Framework modules ( in ` src / jmh / java ` of each \n ` spring - * ` module ) . It ' s also relaxing the checkstyle rules for JMH \n classes , especially around Javadoc rules : this code is not meant to \n have Javadocs . \n Finally , this commit links to a new Wiki page on the project GitHub \n repository documenting the infrastructure and helping contributors to \n run and design benchmarks . \n See gh - 24830
Update Reactor Netty modules \n Since reactor / reactor - netty # 739 , the ` reactor - netty ` module is now split \n into two : ` reactor - netty - core ` and ` reactor - netty - http ` . \n This commit updates the Spring Framework build accordingly .
Polish StartupStep " tags " method \n Renaming the ` tags ` method to ` getTags ` for overall consistency , and \n fixing the Javadoc to mention that this returns an immutable collection . \n Closes gh - 25678
Set DEBUG logs for release tasks in CI pipeline \n This commit configures the logging level to DEBUG for the concourse \n release scripts tasks . \n This is useful to get a clue on where those long - running tasks are at .
Remove spring . event . invoke - listener startup event \n Prior to this commit , the ` SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster ` would be \n instrumented with the ` ApplicationStartup ` and start / stop events for \n invoking event listeners ( ` spring . event . invoke - listener ` ) . \n This feature was already limited to single - threaded event publishers , \n but is still flawed since several types of events can happen \n concurrently . Due to the single - threaded nature of the startup sequence , \n our implementation should not produce startup events concurrently . \n This can cause issues like gh - 26057 , where concurrent events lead to \n inconcistencies when tracking parent / child relationships . \n This commit removes the ` spring . event . invoke - listener ` startup event as \n a result . \n Fixes gh - 26057
Mention security considerations in Forwarded filters \n This commit improves the Javadoc for the ` ForwardedHeaderFilter ` \n ( Servlet Filter ) and ` ForwardedHeaderTransformer ` ( reactive variant ) so \n as to mention security considerations linked to Forwarded HTTP headers . \n Closes gh - 26081
Upgrade JDK 15 CI image to JDK 15 build 24
Update CI to concourse - release - scripts 0 . 2 . 0
Upgrade to spring - doc - resources 0 . 2 . 4 \n Closes gh - 24066
Fix missing sslInfo with Reactor Netty and http / 2 \n Prior to this commit , the ` SslInfo ` would be missing for WebFlux apps \n when deployed on Reactor Netty with http / 2 . \n This commit ensures that the request adapter checks the current channel \n and the parent channel for the presence of the ` SslHander ` . \n In the case of http / 2 , the ` SslHander ` is tied to the parent channel . \n Fixes gh - 25278
Update CI images to use ubuntu : bionic - 20200526
Fix Reactor Core DirectProcessor deprecation \n As of reactor / reactor - core # 2188 , ` DirectProcessor ` variants are \n deprecated . This commit replaces them with the new \n ` FluxIdentityProcessor ` variant . \n See gh - 25085
Fix missing contextPath when mutating ServerHttpRequest \n This commit ensures that when mutating ` ServerHttpRequest ` instances , \n the original contextPath information is copied to the request being \n built . \n Note that mutation on the ` contextPath ( String ) ` or ` path ( String ) ` should \n be reflected to the other . ( See their Javadoc for more information ) . \n Fixes gh - 25279
Early configuration of ApplicationStartup on BeanFactory \n Prior to this commit , the ` GenericApplicationContext ` configured the \n ` AppliationStartup ` on the ` BeanFactory ` only right before refreshing it . \n Delaying this has no purpose and we should instead configure it as soon \n as possible by overriding the setter method . \n Closes gh - 25718
Remove artifactory oss snapshot repository \n The RSocket SNAPSHOTs are now mirrored on the Spring SNAPSHOT \n repository .
Upgrade to Spring Doc Resources 0 . 2 . 5 \n Fixes gh - 24146

Upgrade ActiveMQ and extend timeout in STOMP tests
Revert timeout inscreases in STOMP tests \n This change is not fixing tests but rather increasing their duration , so \n we ' re reverting this change as a result .
Deprecate AppCacheManifestTransformer \n This commit deprecates the ` AppCacheManifestTransformer ` implementations \n since the appcache feature is being removed from the browsers . \n Closes gh - 25733
Upgrade reference docs dependencies \n This commit upgrades the spring - doc - resources dependency to 0 . 2 . 5 \n and the spring - asciidoctor - extensions - block - switch to 0 . 5 . 0
Upgrade CI images to ubuntu : bionic - 20200630
Upgrade to AsciidoctorJ 3 . 1 . 0 \n Closes gh - 24991
Fix missing reference doc from docs archive \n Prior to this commit , the ` docsZip ` task would not reference the new \n output locations for the ` asciidoctor ` and ` asciidoctorPdf ` tasks . \n This results with missing reference docs in the docs zip . \n This commit updates the input locations of the Zip task to include the \n produced reference docs . \n Fixes gh - 25783
Fix image folder name in update detection script \n Fixes gh - 23699
Upgrade to Concourse Release Scripts 0 . 2 . 1 \n This release fixes a bug where Spring Boot specifics were baked in the \n application itself .
Remove Slack " here " mentions for failed builds \n This was introduced by mistake in 6b978cb5dc4
Add HttpEncodingAutoConfiguration to WebMvcTest \n Prior to this commit , tests using the ` @ WebMvcTest ` annotation would not \n include the ` HttpEncodingAutoConfiguration ` . This means that , even if \n configured , the encoding filter would not be configured in MVC tests , \n resulting in an inconsistency with ` @ SpringBootTest ` tests . \n This commit ensures that the ` HttpEncodingAutoConfiguration ` is included \n when ` @ WebMvcTest ` is used . \n Fixes gh - 23749
Fix missing broken link in reference docs \n See gh - 23126
Update JDK 15 version in CI image \n This also switches to the adoptopenjdk - produced binaries for better \n consistency with other JDK versions in our CI .
Upgrade JDK8 , JDK11 and JDK15 versions in CI build
Don ' t swallow logs during promotion job in CI \n Prior to this commit , the promote task in the CI release pipeline would \n write the " concourse - release - scripts " CONSOLE logs to / dev / null ; this \n commit ensures that we can read those while promoting artifacts .
Fix NPE when calling NettyHeadersAdapter . add ( ) \n Prior to this commit , the ` NettyHeadersAdapter ` would directly delegate \n the ` add ( ) ` and ` set ( ) ` calls to the adapted \n ` io . netty . handler . codec . http . HttpHeaders ` . This implementation rejects \n ` null ` values with exceptions . \n This commit aligns the behavior here with other implementations , by not \n rejecting null values but simply ignoring them . \n Fixes gh - 26274
Allow ServerHttpRequest content - type mutation \n Prior to this commit , ` ServerHttpRequest . mutate ( ) ` would not reflect \n changes made on the " Accept " and " Content - Type " HTTP headers . \n This was due to the fact that the instantiation of a new request based \n on the mutated values would not use the writable HTTP headers used \n during the mutation , but rather a read - only view of the headers backed \n by ` ReadOnlyHttpHeaders ` . \n ` ReadOnlyHttpHeaders ` caches those values for performance reasons , so \n getting those from the new request would not reflect the changes made \n during the mutation phase . \n This commit ensures that the new request uses the mutated headers . \n Fixes gh - 26615
Fix docs on probe state during graceful shutdown \n This commit improves the " Application lifefycle and Probes states " \n section and underlines the difference between ` AvailabilityState ` and \n the availability of Probes over HTTP . \n Closes gh - 24843
Fix contextPath request matching with PathPatterns \n Prior to this commit , ` SimpleUrlHandlerMapping ` and other \n implementations of ` AbstractUrlHandlerMapping ` would not strip the \n Servlet context path from the request path before performing path \n matching with PathPattern instances . \n This resulted in requests not matching as expected if the application \n was configured with a Servlet context path . \n This commit ensures that the ` RequestPath ` " path whithin the \n application " is used for matching against path patterns . \n Fixes gh - 26411

Don ' t replace all ' connection ' headers when sending h2c upgrade request ( # 7824 ) \n Motivation : \n There may be meaningful ' connection ' headers that exist on a request \n that is used to attempt a HTTP / 1 . x upgrade request that will be \n clobbered . \n Modifications : \n HttpClientUpgradeHandler uses the ` HttpHeaders . add ` instead of \n ` HttpHeaders . set ` when adding the ' upgrade ' field . \n Result : \n Fixes # 7823 , existing ' connection ' headers are preserved .
Http2MultiplexCodec should propagate unhandled Http2Frames down the pipeline \n Motivation : \n Http2MultiplexCodec swallows Http2PingFrames without releasing the payload , resulting in a memory leak . \n Modification : \n Send unhandled frames down the pipeline for consumption / disposal by another InboundChannelHandler . \n Result : \n Fixes # 7607 .
Motivation : ( # 7848 ) \n It is possible to create streams in the half - closed state where the \n stream state doesn ' t reflect that the request headers have been sent by \n the client or the server hasn ' t received the request headers . This \n state isn ' t possible in the H2 spec as a half closed stream must have \n either received a full request or have received the headers from a \n pushed stream . In the current implementation , this can cause the stream \n created as part of an h2c upgrade request to be in this invalid state \n and result in the omission of RST frames as the client doesn ' t believe \n it has sent the request to begin with . \n Modification : \n The ` DefaultHttp2Connection . activate ` method checks the state and \n modifies the status of the request headers as appropriate . \n Result : \n Fixes # 7847 .
Don ' t fail the deregistration promise in Http2MultiplexCodec \n Motivation : \n We deviate from the AbstractChannel implementation on deregistration by \n failing the provided promise if the channel is already deregistered . In \n contrast , AbstractChannel will always set the promise to successfully \n done . \n Modification : \n Change the \n Http2MultiplexCodec . DefaultHttp2StreamChannel . Http2ChannelUnsafe to \n always set the promise provided to deregister as done as is the \n case in AbstractChannel .
Reorder channel state changes in Http2MultiplexCodec child channel \n Motivation : \n If a write fails for a Http2MultiplexChannel stream channel , the channel \n may be forcibly closed , but only after the promise has been failed . That \n means continuations attached to the promise may see the channel in an \n inconsistent state of still being open and active . \n Modifications : \n Move the satisfaction of the promise to after the channel cleanup logic \n runs . \n Result : \n Listeners attached to the future that resulted in a Failed write will \n see the stream channel in the correct state .
Remove dead code in Http2CodecUtil ( # 8009 ) \n Motivation : \n The ` ByteBuffer emptyPingBuf ( ) ` method of Http2CodecUtils is has been dead \n code since DefaultHttp2PingFrame switched from using a ByteBuf to represent \n the 8 octets to a long . \n Modifications : \n Remove the method and the unused static ByteBuf . \n Result : \n Less dead code . \n Fixes # 8002
Remove uninterpolated ` { } ` in DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder log message ( # 8441 ) \n Motivation : \n There are log messages emitted from Http2ConnectionDecoder of the form \n ` ` ` \n INF i . n . h . c . h . DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder ignoring HEADERS frame for stream RST _ STREAM sent . { } \n ` ` ` \n Modifications : \n Remove the trailing ` { } ` in the log message that doesn ' t have a value . \n Result : \n Log messages no longer have a trailing ` { } ` .
Enable PooledByteBufAllocator to work , event without a cache \n Motivation : \n ` useCacheForAllThreads ` may be false which disables memory caching \n on non netty threads . Setting this argument or the system property \n makes it impossible to use ` PooledByteBufAllocator ` . \n Modifications : \n Delayed the check of ` freeSweepAllocationThreshold ` in \n ` PoolThreadCache ` to after it knows there will be any caches in \n use . Additionally , check if the caches will have any data in them \n ( rather than allocating a 0 - length array ) . \n A test case is also added that fails without this change . \n Results : \n Fixes # 7194
Unify { Epoll , KQueue } EventLoopGroup initialization . \n Motivation : \n ` Epoll . ensureAvailability ( ) ` is called multiple times , once in \n static initialization and in a couple of the constructors . This is \n redundant and confusing to read . \n Modifications : \n Move ` Epoll . ensureAvailability ( ) ` call into an instance initializer \n and remove all other references . This ensures that every EELG \n checks availability , while still delaying the check until \n construction . This pattern is used when there are multiple ctors , \n as in this class . \n Result : \n Easier to read code .
Make DelegatingChannelPromiseNotifier use Vararg overload \n Motivation : \n ErrorProne complains that the array override doesn ' t match the \n vararg super call . See http : / / errorprone . info / bugpattern / Overrides \n Additionally , almost every other Future uses the vararg form , so \n it would be stylistically consistent to keep it that way . \n Modifications : \n Use vararg override . \n Result : \n Cleaner , less naggy code .
Do not define JNI _ OnLoad when not dynamic \n Motivation : \n Due to an oversight ( by myself ) , linking two JNI modules with \n duplicate symbols fails in linking . This only seems to happen \n some of the time ( the behavior seems to be different between GCC \n and Clang toolchains ) . For instance , including both netty tcnative \n and netty epoll fails to link because of duplicate JNI _ OnLoad \n symobols . \n Modification : \n Do not define the JNI _ OnLoad and JNI _ OnUnload symbols when \n compiling for static linkage , as indicated by the NETTY _ BUILD _ STATIC \n preprocessor define . They are never directly called when \n statically linked . \n Result : \n Able to statically compile epoll and tcnative code into a single \n binary .
Use Constructor for reflective class instantiation . \n Motivation : \n Calling ` newInstance ( ) ` on a Class object can bypass compile time \n checked Exception propagation . This is noted in Java Puzzlers , \n as well as in ErrorProne : \n http : / / errorprone . info / bugpattern / ClassNewInstance \n Modifications : \n Use the niladic constructor to create a new instance . \n Result : \n Compile time safety for checked exceptions
Include JNIEXPORT on exported symbols \n Motivation : \n As noticed in https : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 45700277 / \n compilation can fail if the definition of a method doesn ' t \n match the declaration . It ' s easy enough to add this in , and make \n it easy to compile . \n Modifications : \n Add JNIEXPORT to the entry points . \n * On Windows this adds : ` _ _ declspec ( dllexport ) ` \n * On Mac this adds : ` _ _ attribute _ _ ( ( visibility ( " default " ) ) ) ` \n * On Linux ( GCC 4 . 2 + ) this adds : ` _ _ attribute _ _ ( ( visibility ( " default " ) ) ) ` \n * On other it doesn ' t add anything . \n Result : \n Easier compilation
Include more detail why Unsafe is not available \n Motivation : \n PD and PD0 Both try to find and use Unsafe . If unavailable , they \n try to log why and continue on . However , it is not always east to \n enable this logging . Chaining exceptions together is much easier \n to reach , and the original exception is relevant when Unsafe is \n needed . \n Modifications : \n * Make PD log why PD0 could not be loaded with a trace level log \n * Make PD0 remember why Unsafe wasn ' t available \n * Expose unavailability cause through PD for higher level use . \n * Make Epoll and KQueue include the reason when failing \n Result : \n Easier debugging in hard to reconfigure environments
Use threadsafe setter on Atomic Updaters \n Motivation : \n The documentation for field updates says : \n > Note that the guarantees of the { @ code compareAndSet } \n > method in this class are weaker than in other atomic classes . \n > Because this class cannot ensure that all uses of the field \n > are appropriate for purposes of atomic access , it can \n > guarantee atomicity only with respect to other invocations of \n > { @ code compareAndSet } and { @ code set } on the same updater . \n This implies that volatiles shouldn ' t use normal assignment ; the \n updater should set them . \n Modifications : \n Use setter for field updaters that make use of compareAndSet . \n Result : \n Concurrency compliant code
Remove allocation from ResourceLeakDetector \n Motivation : \n RLD allocates an ArrayDeque in anticipation of recording access \n points . If the leak detection level is less than ADVANCED though , \n the dequeue is never used . Since SIMPLE is the default level , \n there is a minor perf win to not preemptively allocate it . \n This showed up in garbage profiling when creation a high number of \n buffers . \n Modifications : \n Only allocate the dequeue if it will be used . \n Result : \n Less garbage created .
Expose all defaults on PooledByteBufAllocator \n Motivation : \n Most , but not all defaults are statically exposed on \n PooledByteBufAllocator . This makes it cumbersome to make a custom \n allocator where most of the defaults remain the same . \n Modification : \n Expose useCacheForAllThreads , and Direct preferred . The latter is \n needed because it is under the internal package , and public code \n should probably not depend on it . \n Result : \n More customizeable allocators
Use WeakReferences for Resource Leaks \n Motivation : \n Phantom references are for cleaning up resources that were \n forgotten , which means they keep their referent alive . This \n means garbage is kept around until the refqueue is drained , rather \n than when the reference is unreachable . \n Modification : \n Use Weak References instead of Phantoms \n Result : \n More punctual leak detection .
Throw FileNotFoundException when connecting to a missing UDS path \n Motivation : \n Exception handling is nicer when a more specific Exception is thrown \n Modification : \n Add a static reference for ENOENT , and throw FNFE if it is returned \n Result : \n More precise exception handling
To detect Android , check the VM property rather than the classpath \n Motivation : \n Some java binaries include android classes on their classpath , even \n if they aren ' t actually android . When this is true , ` Unsafe ` no \n longer works , disabling the Epoll functionality . A sample case is \n for binaries that use the j2objc library . \n Modifications : \n Check the ` java . vm . name ` instead of the classpath . Numerous \n Google - internal Android libraries / binaries check this property \n rather than the class path . \n It is believed this is safe and works with bother ART and Dalvik \n VMs , safe for Robolectric , and j2objc . \n Results : \n Unusually built java server binaries can still use Netty Epoll .
Swap header check in ReadOnlyHttp2Headers \n Motivation : \n Pseudo headers are checked less frequently than normal headers , so \n it is more efficient to check the latter first . \n Modifications : \n Swap the order of the check , and fix minor formatting \n Result : \n Possibly more efficient header checks
Get memory address from Unsafe for OpenSSL \n Motivation : \n Profiling tcnative SSL code showed a non trivial percentage ( 1 % ) \n of time spent in JNI code for InstaceOf . This turned out to be \n from ` Buffer . address ` which makes a JNI call , which safely checks \n on each call that The ByteBuffer is direct . \n Modification : \n Prefer using the address field of the pojo rather than looking it \n up with JNI . This is the same approach taken by the ` OpenSsl ` \n class . \n Result : \n Less JNI overhead
Close SSLEngine when connection fails . \n Motivation : \n When using the JdkSslEngine , the ALPN class is used keep a reference \n to the engine . In the event that the TCP connection fails , the \n SSLEngine is not removed from the map , creating a memory leak . \n Modification : \n Always close the SSLEngine regardless of if the channel became \n active . Also , record the SSLEngine was closed in all places . \n Result : \n Fixes : https : / / github . com / grpc / grpc - java / issues / 3080

Manage VPN legacy state separately from NetworkInfo \n This is mainly a cleanup , but is also necessary for the \n network selection project . \n This is for network selection ultimately because NetworkSelection \n needs NetworkAgents to use the newer API introduced in R rather \n than the legacy internal API . Using that API forbids communicating \n to ConnectivityService through NetworkInfo , and does not support \n the FAILED state because there is no usage in connectivity . \n In VPN , FAILED is used only to communicate a state to Settings \n and it does this through IConnectivityManager . getLegacyVpnInfo , \n which already is using an int to communicate this information . \n Splitting the legacy state from NetworkInfo not only is simpler \n ultimately because it ' s the format in which it ' s consumed , but \n also will allow removing NetworkInfo completely . \n Test : FrameworksNetTests NetworkStackTests \n Bug : 167544279 \n Change - Id : I8b95e020919e38a5166892221096db6271985574

Fix a bug where modern network agents start in UNKNOWN \n Modern network agents are supposed to have the following \n lifecycle : \n • Construct the agent \n • Declare itself to connectivity by calling # register ( ) \n • Possibly do some setup \n • Declare connected by calling # markConnected ( ) \n • Declare disconnected by calling # unregister ( ) \n Internally ConnectivityService still manages the state \n with deprecated NetworkInfo , which has a lot of possible \n detailed states , most of which are now unused . Internally , \n the steps above translate to the states below : \n • When the agent calls # register ( ) it starts in state \n CONNECTING \n • When it calls # markConnected ( ) it goes to CONNECTED \n • When it calls # unregister ( ) it goes to DISCONNECTED which \n triggers the flow that disconnects it immediately \n • ConnectivityService also synthesizes the SUSPENDED state \n under some situations , but that ' s not relevant here . \n The translation above is done by the NetworkAgent class , \n which translates # register ( ) , # markConnected ( ) and \n The only valid lifecyle for new agents is thus : \n CONNECTING → CONNECTED → disconnect \n ↕ ↑ \n SUSPENDED ───┘ \n Note that in the above scheme , there is no space for the \n UNKNOWN state , which is only used by legacy network agents . \n However , the constructor for NetworkInfo still starts with \n UNKNOWN . Ideally the constructor for NetworkInfo would set \n the info to CONNECTING instead , but this would be a very \n visible change in behavior affecting many apps ( especially \n their tests ) , so for backward compatibility we can ' t do \n that . \n New network agents however don ' t expose their NetworkInfo \n to the client code , so they can just be made to start in \n CONNECTING the way it was meant . \n Note that this didn ' t really have a concrete impact beyond \n printing some logs as by and large the ConnectivityService \n code handles UNKNOWN and CONNECTING the same way , or more \n exactly it handles transitions to CONNECTED from UNKNOWN \n and CONNECTING in the same way . The exception to this is \n VPNs , which are not using the new agent API yet , and the \n upcoming conversion is why this fix is actually needed now . \n Bug : 170904131 \n Test : FrameworksNetTests NetworkStackTests \n Test : new test in aosp / 1460705 \n Change - Id : Ib7d906a7b29a0b9f000b90bc78558a7402852fa3

Accelerate build with ccache and lcache ( # 3523 ) ( # 3609 ) \n See https : / / github . com / beeender / lcache for source code for lcache . \n It is very simple right now . It identify if the link target is cached by \n using checksums from command line + checksums of all input files . \n The realm - library gradle check those paths from project properties first \n , then the system env . \n So those can be set in the ~ / . gradle / gradle . properties like : \n ccachePath = / usr / bin / ccache \n lcachePath = / usr / bin / lcache \n Or by system ENVs like : \n NDK _ CCACHE = / usr / bin / ccache \n NDK _ LCACHE = / usr / bin / lcache

Fix a socket timeout issue with test server ( # 5466 ) \n * Fix a socket timeout issue with test server \n If startRealmObjectServer was called twice without stop in between , \n syncServerChildProcess will be overwritten by a terminated process since \n the 2nd call of creating sync server will fail and set the syncServerChildProcess . \n This would make the stopRealmObjectServer get stuck forever . \n In practice , we need to make sure the server has been stopped before \n start it . So just treat the " start " as a " restart " command which will \n stop the sync server if needed . \n Thus , no need to stop in tear down functions in java side anymore . \n * remove useless function
Fix too many open files crash \n Update object store to 163c1e8fb0 to fix # 4002

findFirstAsync returns invalid row if no object \n Fix # 4352 \n The findFirstAsync ( ) ' s behavior doesn ' t match the javadoc from the first \n day the API was introduced . It kept running the query until it could \n find a row match the query condition . This behavior create difficulties \n if user want to check if there is no object in the db .

Remove the hidden ConnectivityManager dependency in NMS \n NetworkManagementService that is outside the incoming \n connectivity module should stop using hidden NETID _ UNSET \n in ConnectivityManager . The only usage in NMS is \n setDnsForwarders ( ) method which is previously used by CS . \n The reference is now replaced by calling INetd directly . \n The method could be removed now , so remove it to resolve \n the dependency . \n Bug : 172183305 \n Test : m ; atest FrameworksNetTests \n Change - Id : I63137b240c4938b082c460bb1a25b447e7f29e80

Fix a bug in LongPriorityQueue internal remove ( # 10832 ) \n Motivation : \n We rely on this functionality in PoolChunk , and a bug was caught by a non - deterministic test failure \n Modification : \n Went back to the Algorithms book , and reimplemented remove ( ) the way it was meant to . \n Result : \n No test failures after 200 . 000 runs , so we have some confidence the code is correct now .
Remove javassist dependency ( # 10514 ) \n Motivation : \n Avoid keeping unused dependencies around . \n Modification : \n Remove all references to javassist dependency , since it does not appear to be used by anything . \n Result : \n One less dependency to worry about .
Disable Maven build HTTP connection pooling ( # 10558 ) \n Motivation : \n The builds often fail when downloading dependencies . \n This might be caused by the build taking a long time , and cause pooled connections to be closed \n by the remote end , if they are idle for too long . \n Modification : \n Disable connection pooling . This should force Maven to reestablish the connection for each download , \n thus reducing the likelihood of the remote end closing connections we wish to use . \n Result : \n I ' ll leave it up the statistis of our CI to confirm , but we should see more stable builds .
Smaller output in codeql build ( # 10787 ) \n Motivation : \n Printing download progress in the build log makes it harder to see what ' s wrong when the build fails . \n Modification : \n Change the maven command to not show transfer progress , also enable batch mode so Maven don ' t print in colors that we can ' t see anyway . \n Result : \n More concise code analysis build logs .
Add a build profile for JDK 16 ( # 10676 ) \n Motivation : \n Java 16 will come around eventually anyway , and this makes it easier for people to experiment with Early Access builds . \n Modification : \n Added Maven profiles for JDK 16 to relevant pom files . \n Result : \n Netty now builds on JDK 16 pre - releases ( provided they ' ve not broken compatibility in some way ) .
Fix # 10614 by making UnorderedTPEExecutor . scheduleAtFixedRate run tasks more than once ( # 10659 ) \n Motivation : \n All scheduled executors should behave in accordance to their API . \n The bug here is that scheduled tasks were not run more than once because we executed the runnables directly , instead of through the provided runnable future . \n Modification : \n We now run tasks through the provided future , so that when each run completes , the internal state of the task is reset and the ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor is informed of the completion . \n This allows the executor to prepare the next run . \n Result : \n The UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor is now able to run scheduled tasks more than once . \n Which is what one would expect from the API .
Fix netty _ unix _ errors . c compilation on MacOS ( # 10469 ) \n Motivation : \n The feature test macros did not work as expected on MacOS , so we ended up compiling for the GNU \n variant which resulted in compilation errors . \n Modification : \n Add ` _ _ APPLE _ _ ` as another indicator to use the XSI variant of ` strerror _ r ` . \n Result : \n The project now once again compiles on MacOS .
Avoid name - clash with future java . lang . Record ( # 10470 ) \n Motivation : \n Recent Intellij versions are starting to anticipate \n future versions of Java that include a \n ` java . lang . Record ` class , and the Intellij compiler \n gets confused by the ` Record ` class in our \n ` ResorceLeakDetector ` . \n Modification : \n Rename our ` Record ` class to ` TracerRecord ` . \n This matches what the class is doing , while avoiding \n any future name clashes . \n Result : \n Intellij can now compile the project again , even when \n configured to use a future ( snapshot or early access ) \n version of Java .
Fix overflow bug in GenericEventExecutorChooser ( # 10468 ) \n Motivation : \n The executor chooser should pluck executors in round - robin , but at the 32 - bit \n overflow boundary , the round - robin sequence was disrupted when the number of \n executors are not a power of 2 . \n Modification : \n Changed the index counter from a 32 - bit to a 64 - bit long . The overflow bug is \n still technically there , but it now takes so long to reach that it will never \n happen in practice . For example , 2 ^ 63 nanoseconds is almost 300 years . \n Result : \n The round - robin behaviour for all EventExecutorChoosers is now preserved in \n practice . \n This fixes # 10423 .
Let object serialisation exceptions propagate in the Object Echo example ( # 10807 ) \n Motivation : \n People may use the object serialisation example as a vehicle to test out sending their own objects across the wire . \n If those objects are not actually serialisable for some reason , then we need to let the exception propagate so that this becomes obvious to people . \n Modification : \n Add a listener to the future that sends the first serialisable message , so that we ensure that any exceptions that shows up during serialisation becomes visible . \n Without this , the state of the future that sent the first message was never checked or inspected anywhere . \n Result : \n Serialisation bugs in code derived from the Object Echo example are much easier to diagnose . \n This fixes # 10777

Prefer LHM over HashMap , and remove a stray synchronized keyword .

Fix JIT binding attempts for generic or annotated keys . \n This should never happen normally , but in some cases - notably proguard cases - where an ` @ Provides ` method is not pre - loaded , the attempt to bind falls into the jit - binding and built - in binding case . This results in a null className , and the current error is obscure . Instead , just throw an IAE with the key which is caught and reported in a less crappy way . \n Unfortunately , this is nearly impossible to test , without hacking up the build system . : (
Revert " Remove now - unnecessary linker parent checking for lookup . " \n This reverts commit cbde60be6f3a4722eb5a9220296ed52093f595d5 .
A configuration to permit travis to install the android SDK before running continuous build .
Reduce the set of things needed for building the android examples .
Propagate SetBindings settings in the copy constructor .
Loosen the extent to which we trap and report exceptions . \n A few are thrown by javac internals - most notably com . sun . tools . javac . code . Symbol - that javac knows how to deal with . Or at the very least , trapping these and reporting them as build errors on elements is misleading . \n So in the above case , pass the exception through . The code change uses a set , to leave room for adding others when and if they show up ( whether from javac or other sources , like ecj , etc . ) \n This change also alters the wording of the reported error when we don ' t pass through , so it ' s clearer this isn ' t coming from a Dagger validation failure , but a deeper cause .

Annotation processor no longer consume annotations ( # 3216 ) \n This commit changes the Realm annotation processor so it no longer consumes the annotations . The only effect this has is that it is now possible to write multiple annotation processors for the same annotation . \n It is not possible to specify the order of annotation processors from two different libraries , so if one of the processors consumed the annotation it would be random if both ran or only one of them .
Clarify how to check exceptions in unit tests .
Fixed RealmList not creating DynamicRealmObject of the correct type .

Better exception message when using custom migrations ( # 2715 ) \n Custom migration classes has been a source of quite a few support questions . This commit adds an extra check for that specific case in order to generate a better exception message that also points to a fix . \n The alternative was to ignore the Migration class when comparing RealmConfigurations , and even though that would be very unlikely it could also lead to some very subtle bugs . By doing it this way , we stick to the normal semantics of Java equality .

Remove HandlerController from the public API . ( # 2632 ) \n HandlerController was made public by mistake . This is an class only used by internal API ' s , so shouldn ' t be public . \n Most likely it was public due to a testing class ( HandlerProxy ) in a separate package needing access to it . HandlerProxy was instead moved to io . realm to work around this as keeping the public API clean has priority .

Bugfix for crashes under Windows / Linux when " 1 < < 30 " didn ' t properly initalize .
Revert " Bugfix for crashes under Windows / Linux when " 1 < < 30 " didn ' t properly initalize . " \n This reverts commit 36dc9706821e4d0867c376cb0a669e5405504210 .
Fix compile problem in Eclipse ( # 64694 ) \n Eclipse IDE compiler needs the TreeSet type to be explicit , at least in version 4 . 16 . 0 , otherwise the \n " pollFirst " / " pollLast " calls later in the method cannot be resolved .

Relaxing score comparisons for rank _ eval tests ( # 68976 ) \n The currently allowed delta in this tests is to strict to account for slight floating point \n differences across different platforms , e . g . ARM . \n Closes # 68936
Prevent field API NPEs from token _ count fields inside nested ( # 69068 ) \n Currently when a ` token _ count ` field is defined inside a nested field , we get an \n NPE because the underlying DocValueFetcher needs its formattedDocValues to be \n loaded and the SourceLookup it sees needs to have a valid docId other than - 1 . \n This change fixes those issues so the whole fields request doesn ' t error . \n However this change doesn ' t solve the missing support for doc values lookup \n under nested fields described in 68983 . Fortunately ` token _ count ` seems to be the only \n mapping type currently affected . \n Relates to # 68983

[ android ] Require check be run in travis build
[ android ] Go back to sdk 21 \n This will fix our Travis build since Travis doesn ' t have 22 at the \n moment .
[ android ] Cancel prev . notifications on new scan \n This restores previous behavior and fixes a bug . Currently , if \n a user encounters 2 + URLs and then later encounters exactly 1 URL , \n two notifications are displayed . If we kill all the notifications \n at the beginning of a scan , we remove the risk of this happening .
Make all UriBeacon notifications public on Lollipop \n There doesn ' t seem to be any reason why public beacons would give \n anything other than public notifications . This change makes beacons \n publicly visible on the Android 5 . 0 lock screen when the user has \n " hide sensitive notification content " selected . \n However , this change keeps urls discovered through mdns or ssdp as \n private .
Ensure the discovery service starts at boot \n Previously , a user would have to reopen the application after rebooting \n in order to start the discovery service again . This starts it \n automatically if they have opted in .
Use full siteUrl to update summary notification \n The summary notification was being updated with short urls , depending \n on what was provided by the beacon . This change ensures that they use \n the full siteUrl provided by the metadata service .
[ android ] Restart scanners on refresh \n This fixes a bug with refreshing mdns results , since mdns results \n are typically only found once in a scan , and not frequently like ble \n results .
Use maven to fetch our . jar libraries . \n This change removes the . jar files from our source tree and fetches \n them via maven .
[ android ] Add a metadata debug view
[ android ] Change notify priority from low to min \n This takes the notification off the lockscreen and off the status bar . \n They become discoverable only on expanding the notification shade . \n More info : \n http : / / developer . android . com / design / patterns / notifications . html
[ android ] Use PWS dev server in debug mode
[ android ] Fix sorting bug \n We had been using device addresses to do metadata lookups where urls \n were the expected key . As one might expect , this led to arbitrarily \n sorted values .
[ android ] Fix unchecked ops and deprecations \n Additionally , add checks for these things to build . gradle .
[ android ] Cleanup errs from debug output change
[ android ] Bump version for new release
[ android ] Remove unhelpful url from debug display
[ android ] Update UI when emptying metadata queue \n The whole intend of queueing up metadata before emptying into in the \n adapter is so that we can control when the information is displayed . \n This is a partial fix for issue # 445
[ android ] Use setServiceUuid to build scan filter \n Not only is this simpler , but this ensures that other mask values , etc . \n are set to null and not an empty byte array . This ensures that all the \n appropriate beacons show up and fixes a bug that hid some in the \n surfaced notifications .
[ android ] Consolidate start / stop code in service
[ android ] Safe start / stop mdns discovery \n The NsdManager likes to complain if we start or stop it while it is \n already in the desired state . This change turns our \n start / stopScanning methods into safe methods that check the state of \n the scanner before performing the operation .
[ android ] Add a PwoDiscoverer class \n This class is designed to provide a standard interface to all classes \n that discover Physical Web Objects and provide some common \n functionality .
[ android ] Convert mdns discoverer to PwoDiscoverer \n This change turns the old MdnsUrlDiscoverer class into a \n MdnsPwoDiscoverer class .
[ android ] Use the new PwoDiscoverer class \n Although no class actually extends this class yet , this change places \n a list of discovery services into our service and fragment so that it \n can be populated with discoverers at a later time .
[ android ] Further fortify mdns start / stop \n The mdns scan start / stop still isn ' t robust enough . The reason seems to be \n that while we are waiting on a response , client code can call start / stop a \n second time and the NsdManager doesn ' t like that .
[ android ] Refresh without killing DiscoveryService \n This change will also prepare us for when the service chaches \n PwoMetadata objects because at that point merely killing the \n service won ' t be enough to force a refresh .
[ android ] Require explicit call to DL favicon \n This is desirable for three reasons : \n 1 . These are independent features of the PWS , the calls should be made \n distinct \n 2 . The BeaconConfigFragment doesn ' t use the icon , so we shouldn ' t \n download it \n 3 . When we start caching PWOs in the discovery service , we ' ll need to \n fetch icons if we already have the url metadata , but no icon .
[ android ] Use start / end instead of begin / end \n start / end is considered better because it enables bidi support .
[ android ] Remove pwo discoverers from fragment \n These are only needed in the discovery service .
[ android ] Restore old preference file name \n This will prevent users from having to accept the terms in the Oob \n activity twice .
Read signing configuration from signing . gradle \n Instead of manually pasting configuration values into gradle or \n studio on each release , this lets the developer keep a \n signing . properties file with the necessary information .
Bump the version number to 0 . 1 . 852 for Android \n This also bumps the target SDK to 22 .
Bump Android version name to 0 . 1 . 853
[ android ] Returned stored PwoMetadata to clients \n Currently , when the Fragment refreshes , we hand it newly discovered \n PwoMetadata objects . However , because the service ( typically ) already \n has the UrlMetadata and the icon , this can prevent the fragment from \n being subscribed to the UrlMetadata on refresh . Instead of giving the \n client the newly discovered PwoMetadata objects , we give it the stored \n one that matches the url of the newly discovered one .
[ android ] Do not fetch urlMetadata in fragment \n The service is supposed to be handling this . Additionally , it creates \n warring fetches that end up confusing things and images don ' t download .
[ android ] Handle scanning startup in onCreate \n onStartService isn ' t the place to do this since we only want to start \n scanning once . The android docs seem to indicate that onCreate doesn ' t \n have to be merely used for variable instantiation , but can also start \n threads as shown in one of their own examples . \n http : / / developer . android . com / guide / components / services . html
Deserialize to UrlDevice , not to specific subclass \n The UrlDeviceJsonSerializer is designed to serialize a specific \n subclass of UrlDevice and de serialize a specific subclass of \n UrlDevice . We should not dictate what it deserializes to , only what \n it deserializes from . This will allow updated versions of clients to \n transition between subclasses of UrlDevice .
Suppress duplicate literals in PWC test \n This gets travis gree again .
Order conditional positively in beacon config \n This is a simple readability cleanup that reverses a set of \n if / else blocks so that the condition can be stated positively .
[ android ] Use a scoped preference file name \n " " " \n When naming your shared preference files , you should use a name that ' s \n uniquely identifiable to your app , such as \n " com . example . myapp . PREFERENCE _ FILE _ KEY " \n " " " \n http : / / developer . android . com / training / basics / data - storage / shared - preferences . html
Add location permission \n This allows to do scanning on screen wakeup on M .
Build collection lib along with the Android app
Don ' t send empty requests to PWS \n If there are no new URLs to get metadata for , don ' t send a request \n to PWS .
Make http classes package private \n There are several classe that don ' t need to be exposed to developers . \n This change makes them package private .
[ PWS ] Start / stop auto test server more reliably
Add a helper method to grab a top pair for a group
Implementation for issue # 144 \n Added additional public method , setMissingExceptionMessage , to allow a \n user to specify a custom message that would be thrown in the event a \n test did not throw the expected exception . If one is not provided the \n class falls back to the previous behavior .
Modified test method name to be consistent \n The test method name was never updated . Updated the test method name to \n be consistent with what the test was executing .
Changed exception message method name \n Changed method name from setMissingExceptionMessage to \n reportMissingExceptionWithMessage to be more consistent with the \n existing API .
Converted tabs to spaces \n Converted tabs to spaces for newly added code to be in line with \n guidelines .
Refactored logic out of failDueToMissingException \n Refactored message decision logic out of failDueToMissingException into \n its own method missingExceptionMessage .

Add missing varparam to super call when overriding \n This commits fixes a regression introduced in 240c51e8 . \n We use the dedicated JMethod # varParam ( ) API to add the variable length \n parameter , however we only added normal parameters to the super \n call . Now we also add the dedicated varparam to the super call as well .
Make varparams final in overriden methods \n This fixes a regression introduced in 240c51e8 . \n We use the dedicated JMethod # varParam ( ) API to add the varparam to \n the overriden method signature , however the ` final ` modifier was left \n out . Now we add the ` final ` modifier to variable length parameters as \n well .

Fix SNAPSHOT deployment \n The location for settings . xml was incorrect .
Support R2 class for resource values \n The R class contains non - constant fields in case of library projects , \n so we cannot use them in annotation values , nor for validaiton , since \n the values are not available at compile time . To work around this , \n there is a Gradle plugin to generate an R2 class , which contains \n constants fields . \n This commit adds a very simple integration to this plugin , by using the \n R2 class instead of R if the former is available .
Add @ JvmField example in Kotlin sample project
Use normal R class even when validating with R2 \n The final resource values will not be the same as the compile - time values , \n so we have to use the R class in the generated code , even if the user set \n to use the R2 class in annotation parameters . \n Follow - up fix for : \n https : / / github . com / androidannotations / androidannotations / pull / 2022

Fix missing signing and upload properties issue \n When developer does not have signing and / or sonatype properties set in \n their environment the gradle script used to blow up . \n I have ' fixed ' this by providing default values for sonatypeUsername \n and sonatypePassword if they do not exist . In regards to signing \n the workaround is to only require signing when doing a release .
Set project name rather than archivesBaseName \n Project name is a read only property in build . gradle , but it can be set \n in settings . gradle . This makes things more uniform and deterministic . \n Project now has the same name no matter which directory you check it \n out to . \n It also helps with Intellij IDEA not creating additional modules and \n subsequently having conflicts between them .
Update source and target compatibility to 1 . 6
If set use JAVA _ HOME to resolve path to javac

Add perfClasses as dependency to build . \n This is so that perf classes will always be compiled as part of " main " \n build task in order to prevent compilation errors .
Remove buildAll task from gradle script \n As it was superseded by the fact that build now compiles perf \n classes as well .
Break dependency between perf and test \n Dependency on test from perf was introduced via DaemonThreadFactory . Since \n perf does not logically depend on test it was decided to break the \n physical dependency . DaemonThreadFactory is deemed general purpose utility \n and was moved to main .

Avoid making too many multiplications in transformer \n Each value takes 3 multiplications ( 3 matrices ) , when each Matrix is actually 9 values . \n Now for one value , multiplying 3 time with the matrix ( X * = M1 , X * = M2 , X * = M3 ) \n When you take 10 values - it ' s 30 multiplications ( and X9 ) \n The new approach pre - multiplies the 3 matrices into 1 . So : \n First value is multiplied by the matrix , meaning 3 multiplications for the first value ( M1 * M2 * M3 * X ) \n But for 10 values , we have 12 multiplications ( M = M1 * M2 * M3 , M * X1 , M * X2 , M * X3 . . . M * X10 )

Do not let slice spacing make the chart go haywire . ( Fixes # 1582 ) \n If the user provides data that does not allow the spacing to stay even - \n he will need to manually fix that ( i . e by giving a larger inner hole ) \n Even with a hole - with very small slices it will not help . \n Spacing could be reduces , and small slices can be removed from the dataset .

[ Transform ] Fix transform internal index test ( # 69617 ) \n Fixes an internal cluster test that was migrated from being \n a REST test by the system indices project . \n The REST test framework waits for pending tasks between tests \n whereas the internal cluster test framework does not . The \n particular test that was migrated requires this functionality , \n as updating a transform triggers an async side effect : writing \n an audit message . \n This PR does not add the wait for pending tasks step to all \n internal cluster tests . Clearly it is not required for most , \n and could slow down tests that don ' t require it .

We were not considering the possibility that one or more \n existing . ml - state * indices might be hidden . \n 2 . If multiple jobs tried to create a . ml - state - 000001 index \n simultaneously all but the first would fail . We accounted \n for this , but then did not follow up with the correct alias \n update request for those index creation requests that \n failed . This could cause all but one of the jobs starting \n up on the node to spuriously fail . \n Both these problems are fixed by this PR . \n Fixes # 68925

Explain size limit for transport messages ( # 65803 ) \n If a node receives an unreasonably large transport message then it \n rejects it and closes the connection . This can occur if , for instance , a \n rather small node tries to join a cluster with a rather oversized \n cluster state . The message logged in this case says that the message is \n too large but does not give any clues to the user what to do about it . \n This commit adds to the message the information that the limit is 30 % of \n the node ' s heap size , to give a hint that a larger heap might help .
Add snapshots to important config list ( # 65338 ) \n The _ Important Elasticsearch configuration _ docs lists a number of items \n that you should consider before moving to production . Today this list \n does not include configuring snapshots , even though they ' re very \n important to have in production . This commit addresses that omission , \n removes some repetition from the introductory paragraphs , and notes that \n this config is handled for you on Cloud . \n Co - authored - by : James Rodewig < 40268737 + jrodewig @ users . noreply . github . com >
Add apparently - unnecessary generic type ( # 65495 ) \n Some IntelliJ installations report a mysterious error if this type \n parameter is replaced with ` < > ` , even though the code compiles and runs \n just fine . The search for the reason behind this error has proved \n fruitless . For those installations this commit improves it to a mere \n warning about the unnecessary suppression , and the suppression avoids \n any extra noise for installations that are working properly .
Clarify snapshot incrementality ( # 65587 ) \n Today we describe snapshots as " incremental " but their incrementality is \n rather different beast from e . g . incremental filesystem backups . With \n traditional backups you take a large and relatively infrequent " full " \n backup and then a sequence of smaller " incremental " ones , and this whole \n sequence of backups is required for a restore so it must be kept around \n until at least the next full backup . In contrast , Elasticsearch \n snapshots are logically independent and each can be deleted without \n affecting the integrity of the others . \n This distinction frequently causes confusion amongst newer users , so \n this commit clarifies what we mean by " incremental " in the docs .
Give a less dangerous example of logger config ( # 66318 ) \n Today the docs use ` logger . org . elasticsearch . transport : TRACE ` as the \n example for adjusting the logger config . This is a dangerous thing to \n suggest since that ' s one of the most verbose loggers we have . An \n accidental copy - and - paste of this example into a busy cluster can \n cause damage . \n This commit suggests ` logger . org . elasticsearch . discovery : DEBUG ` \n instead , which is much more benign . \n It also corrects the order of the levels and notes that ` DEBUG ` and \n ` TRACE ` are only for expert use .
Fix Log4J config example in docs ( # 66386 ) \n We lost the ` logger . transport . name ` line in # 65169 and I incorrectly \n extrapolated from what was left and mangled it further in # 66318 . This \n commit fixes things .

Suppress warning on request if transport not ready ( # 69686 ) \n Today we bind to our transport address ( es ) very early in the startup of \n a node so that we know the addresses to which we ' re bound , even though \n we are not yet ready to handle any requests . If we receive a request in \n this state then we throw an ` IllegalStateException ` which results in a \n logged warning and the connection being closed . In practice , this \n happens straight away since the first request on the connection , the \n handshake , is sent as soon as it ' s open . \n This commit introduces a ` TransportNotReadyException ` for this specific \n case , and suppresses the noisy logging on such exceptions . \n Relates # 44939 \n Relates # 16746 \n Closes # 61356
Fix ensureGreen ( ) timeout in REST tests ( # 69704 ) \n In 2a04118e88c6195ac73fb4157a322cd8c3435525 we moved ` ensureGreen ( ) ` \n from ` IndexingIT ` to ` ESRestTestCase ` , including its ` 70s ` timeout . This \n timeout makes sense in the context of an ` AbstractRollingTestCase ` which \n has a client timeout of ` 90s ` ( # 26781 ) but general - purpose REST tests \n only have a ` 60s ` client timeout , so if ` ensureGreen ( ) ` fails then it \n fails with a ` SocketTimeoutException ` , bypassing the useful exception \n handling that log the cluster state at time of failure . \n This commit reduces the ` ensureGreen ( ) ` timeout for most tests , leaving \n it at ` 70s ` only for ` AbstractRollingTestCase ` .
Describe why testFailedTasksCount fails ( # 69734 ) \n Today TransportTasksActionTests # testFailedTasksCount fails reporting an \n unexpectedly - running task , but doesn ' t tell us anything about what that \n task might be or where it ' s running . This commit adds a much more \n descriptive message on failure to help us understand why this test fails \n sometimes . \n Relates # 69731
Respect CloseIndexRequest # waitForActiveShards in HLRC ( # 67374 ) \n Also includes some changes for ` master ` that make # 67246 a bit smaller . \n Relates # 67158
Clarify bootstrap check failure messages ( # 67501 ) \n Today a bootstrap check failure results in a multi - line log message , for \n example : \n [ ERROR ] [ o . e . b . Bootstrap ] node validation exception \n [ 2 ] bootstrap checks failed \n [ 1 ] : system call filters failed to install ; check the logs and fix your configuration or disable system call filters at your own risk \n [ 2 ] : the default discovery settings are unsuitable for production use ; at least one of [ discovery . seed _ hosts , discovery . seed _ providers , cluster . initial _ master _ nodes ] must be configured \n We get frequent questions about bootstrap check failures that indicate \n some users see the ` bootstrap checks failed ` message but struggle to see \n that the actionable details are on the following lines . \n This commit adds extra information to this message to help link the \n lines together and lead users more explicitly from the top - level failure \n down to the actions they need to take : \n [ ERROR ] [ o . e . b . Bootstrap ] node validation exception \n [ 2 ] bootstrap checks failed . You must address the points described in the following [ 2 ] lines before starting Elasticsearch . \n bootstrap check failure [ 1 ] of [ 2 ] : system call filters failed to install ; check the logs and fix your configuration or disable system call filters at your own risk \n bootstrap check failure [ 2 ] of [ 2 ] : the default discovery settings are unsuitable for production use ; at least one of [ discovery . seed _ hosts , discovery . seed _ providers , cluster . initial _ master _ nodes ] must be configured
Remove comment re . listener threadpool ( # 67516 ) \n In # 53314 we removed the listener threadpool but left in place a \n now - mysterious comment about its configuration . This commit removes the \n orphaned comment .
Stop ignoring exceptions in mock loggers ( # 67627 ) \n Today when testing loggers we use ` MockLogAppender ` which is configured \n to ignore exceptions encountered during logging . These exceptions are \n captured by the ` StatusLogger ` and ultimately cause tests to fail , but \n the failure lacks the context we need to diagnose the problem . \n This commit sets the ` ignoreExceptions ` flag to ` false ` on all \n ` MockLogAppender ` objects so that exceptions are thrown to the caller \n for a more informative debugging experience . \n Relates # 66630 \n Relates # 67117
Further emphasise filesystem backups don ' t work ( # 67634 ) \n In # 33102 we added a warning against using filesystem backups . \n Experience has shown that the wording we added was insufficiently \n general and open to misinterpretation . This commit reworks it to be \n clearer . \n This commit also clarifies that snapshots are not incremental across \n repositories .
Assert getRepositoryData only on master node ( # 67780 ) \n A trap for the uninitiated : only the master should be calling \n ` getRepositoryData ( ) ` , but today this isn ' t checked anywhere so there ' s \n a risk that we inadvertently introduce some code that gets the \n repository data on other nodes too . This commit introduces an assertion \n to catch that .
Revert " Assert getRepositoryData only on master node ( # 67780 ) " \n This PR caused test failures after merge , one of which was subsequently \n muted . It ' s quite possible that this isn ' t the only test that ' s now \n broken so this commit reverts it ( and the muting ) pending further \n investigation . \n This reverts commit e8ed1b441b36df6dab056e5bc6460635aacde259 . \n This reverts commit b467595564c49afa386539670657e41d7fe2961d .
Assert getRepositoryData only on master node ( # 67806 ) \n A trap for the uninitiated : only the master should be calling \n ` getRepositoryData ( ) ` , but today this isn ' t checked anywhere so there ' s \n a risk that we inadvertently introduce some code that gets the \n repository data on other nodes too . This commit introduces an assertion \n to catch that . \n Second attempt at # 67780 which was reverted due to test failures .

Extend default probe connect / handshake timeouts ( # 68059 ) \n Today the discovery phase has a short 1 - second timeout for handshaking \n with a remote node after connecting , which allows it to quickly move on \n and retry in the case of connecting to something that doesn ' t respond \n straight away ( e . g . it isn ' t an Elasticsearch node ) . \n This short timeout was necessary when the component was first developed \n because each connection attempt would block a thread . Since # 42636 the \n connection attempt is now nonblocking so we can apply a more relaxed \n timeout . \n If transport security is enabled then our handshake timeout applies to \n the TLS handshake followed by the Elasticsearch handshake . If the TLS \n handshake alone takes over a second then the whole handshake times out \n with a ` ConnectTransportException ` , but this does not tell us which of \n the two individual handshakes took so long . \n TLS handshakes have their own 10 - second timeout , which if reached yields \n a ` SslHandshakeTimeoutException ` that allows us to distinguish a problem \n at the TLS level from one at the Elasticsearch level . Therefore this \n commit extends the discovery probe timeouts .
Drop gateway . recover _ after _ nodes from default conf ( # 68000 ) \n The ` gateway . recover _ after _ nodes ` setting is one of the lucky few that \n gets a mention in the default ` elasticsearch . yml ` config file . This \n setting was deprecated in favour of ` gateway . recover _ after _ data _ nodes ` \n in # 53646 , but neither of these settings is really important enough to \n warrant a place in the default config so this commit removes it .
Fix off - by - one in testDoesNotSubmitRerouteTaskTooFrequently ( # 68316 ) \n We reroute when the elapsed time is > = 60000ms , but the test assumes \n that no reroute happens exactly at 60000ms . This commit fixes this \n off - by - one - ms error .
Fix lower size bounds in RandomBlobContent * Tests ( # 69771 ) \n The repository analyzer does not write empty blobs to the repository , \n and we assert that the blobs are nonempty , but the tests randomly check \n for the empty case anyway . This commit ensures that the blobs used in \n tests are always nonempty . \n Relates # 67247
Make GET / _ cat / segments cancellable ( # 69020 ) \n A small followup to # 67413 and # 68965 : the underlying actions of the \n ` GET / _ cat / segments ` API are now cancellable , so we may as well cancel \n them if needed .
Use ActionRunnable # wrap not ActionRunnable # run ( # 69047 ) \n Fixes a bug introduced in # 67247 .

Permit overwritten blobs to be missing ( # 69102 ) \n Today blob overwrites are not completely atomic , there is an \n intermediate state in which the blob is missing , but the repository \n analyser does not fully account for that intermediate state . \n This commit relaxes the check for missing blobs if they were \n overwritten . \n Closes # 69087
Fix docs for behaviour of CCR after lease expiry ( # 69114 ) \n Today we imply that CCR will automatically fall back to a full index \n copy if it cannot replay any missing history . This was true for earlier \n versions of the design but we ultimately decided not to do this without \n adjusting the docs to match . This commit fixes the docs .
Alloc . awareness should ignore nodes without attr ( # 69374 ) \n Today we count ` null ` ( i . e . missing ) as a valid attribute value in \n allocation awareness , even though allocation awareness forbids the \n allocation of shards to such a node . Prior to # 69334 this didn ' t matter , \n a data node without allocation attributes was pointless . \n However , # 69334 means we now can allocate shards to such a node : for \n instance , there is no need for nodes holding only enrich indices to have \n allocation attributes . Therefore we should stop counting ` null ` as one \n of the attribute values .
Document searchable snapshots supported repos ( # 69508 ) \n Adds a note listing the repository types that can be used with \n searchable snapshots .
Link to repo analyser from docs on S3 - compat repos ( # 69513 ) \n Adds a link to the repository analyser API from the docs regarding \n " S3 - compatible " repository types .
Remove mention of repositories . s3 . base _ path in doc ( # 69516 ) \n We removed the global ` repositories . s3 . base _ path ` setting in 6 . 0 but it \n is still mentioned in the docs for the S3 repository plugin . This commit \n removes it from the docs . \n Relates # 24445
Fix testRepositoryAnalysis ( # 69538 ) \n This test would occasionally generate an invalid request in which the \n max total data size cannot be satisfied . This commit ensures the max \n total data size is always sufficiently large . \n Relates # 67247 \n Closes # 69219

Stop ignoring exceptions in mock loggers ( # 67117 ) \n Today when testing loggers we use ` MockAppender ` which is configured to \n ignore exceptions encountered during logging . These exceptions are \n captured by the ` StatusLogger ` and ultimately cause tests to fail , but \n the failure lacks the context we need to diagnose the problem . \n This commit sets the ` ignoreExceptions ` flag to ` false ` on all \n ` MockAppender ` objects so that exceptions are thrown to the caller for a \n more informative debugging experience . \n Relates # 66630
Simplify implementation of StepListener # thenCombine ( # 68640 ) \n Also generalises it to support different listener types , similarly to \n ` CompletableFuture # thenCombine ` .

Gradle : Use androidApplicationMk for extra APP _ STL for bullet jnigen configuration .
Gradle : use buildscript dependency way of loading plugin . \n * Is in allprojects , and could be limited to only some , but do we care ? \n * Removed plugin repo changes .
LWJGL3 : Window positioning fixes . \n * Fix # 5845 by explicitly calling glfwMaximizeWindow instead of only using glfwWindowHint . glfwWindowHint is still necessary for Linux . \n * Fix position for maximized window when specifying maximizedMonitor . \n * Center default window on primary monitor ' s working area .
Gradle : Proper runtimeClasspath usage when creating desktop ' s dist uber jar . \n * See https : / / docs . gradle . org / current / userguide / working _ with _ files . html \n * For project dependencies ` compileClasspath ` points to class file directories , but does not contain resources . \n * For project dependencies ` runtimeClasspath ` points to fully built jar files . \n * ` configurations . runtimeClasspath . collect ` does not build these jars , so we have to manually add it via ` dependsOn ` \n * Actually actually fix # 5716
Minor cleanup for code merged into AndroidInput from AndroidInputThreePlus
Use 2 . 0 . 0 - SNAPSHOT for gdx - jnigen
Remove Build class reference from OisTest . \n * Just assume they have this lib built . Does anyone even run this ?

[ ML ] Reduce log noise in BaseMlIntegTestCase ( # 65675 ) \n Tests inheriting ` BaseMlIntegTestCase ` have noisy \n logs with the error ` No processor type exists with name [ . . . ] ` . \n Those are caused because of loaded templates that need \n the ` IngestCommonPlugin ` loaded . \n This commit adds a test dependency to the ` ingest - common ` module \n and loads ` IngestCommonPlugin ` in ` BaseMlIntegTestCase ` to reduce \n such noise .
[ ML ] Update serialization versions for revert snapshot force param ( # 65680 )
[ ML ] Mute failing MlDistributedFailureIT test ( # 65747 ) \n Relates # 64710
[ ML ] Further mutes on DFA upgrade tests ( # 64545 ) \n Because of # 64503 . This adds to # 64540 .
[ ML ] Actually fix DFA mixed cluster tests ( # 64551 ) \n Relates # 64503 .
[ ML ] Increase timeout for RegressionIT . testAliasFields job to run ( # 64866 ) \n I looked into the failures for this test as reported in # 63268 . \n Nothing seems odd . The tests failed because the job did not complete \n within the 30 seconds we provide . This seems to be happening on \n CI workers occasionally . As the test is useful , I think it is ok \n to increase the timeout a bit and see how it goes . \n Fixes # 63268
[ Transform ] Fix casting in ExceptionRootCauseFinder ( # 66123 ) \n Method ` getRootCauseException ` is checking whether the unwrapped \n exception is an instance of ` SearchPhaseExecutionException ` but then \n proceeds to cast the parent exception . This would lead to a casting \n error . This commit fixes this and adds a unit test to guard it .
[ ML ] Add debug logging showing extracted rows for DFA jobs ( # 65007 ) \n This is helpful to debug discrepancies between different runs \n of the same job .
[ ML ] Increase timeout waiting for DFA jobs to finish in integ tests ( # 65126 ) \n It appears that occasionally 30 seconds are not enough for CI workers \n to complete DFA jobs . In order to eliminate such failures we increase \n the time we wait for DFA jobs to complete in integration tests to \n 60 seconds . \n Fixes # 64926
[ DOCS ] Add missing " with " in remote reindex doc ( # 65532 )
[ ML ] DFA _ explain API should not fail when none field is included ( # 66281 ) \n This commit fixes an issue with DFA _ explain API where if it is called \n and no field is included , it results to an error message coming from \n the c + + process due to the data frame having no columns . \n We want the _ explain API not to error when no fields are included \n exactly in order to explain to the user why it is that no fields \n are included . Thus , we can simply fix this by not running the \n memory estimation process and returning zero estimates instead . \n Note that the _ start API will fail with a user friendly error message \n that informs there are no included fields .
[ ML ] Adjust data counts log _ time serialization versions ( # 66437 ) \n After backporting # 66343
[ TEST ] Ensure ` InvalidateApiKeyRequest ` has at least one key in test ( # 66696 ) \n Fixes potential failure in ` InvalidateApiKeyRequestTests ` where \n a request is constructed with empty keys . \n Relates # 66317
[ ML ] Unmute RegressionIT . testStopAndRestart with process logging ( # 68266 ) \n Relates # 67581
[ ML ] Remove DFA job states reindexing and analyzing from docs ( # 67658 ) \n These states do no longer exist as of # 67423
[ ML ] Persist data counts in DFA final step with ML origin ( # 67674 ) \n In # 67623 I moved persisting the data counts at the end of a \n data frame analytics job into a ` FinalStep ` class . However , \n I forgot to execute the index request with ML origin resulting \n in authentication problems if the user that runs the DFA job \n does not have read privileges in the ML stats index . \n This commit fixes this by executing that index request with ML \n origin .
Add missing space in installing modules log message ( # 67593 ) \n Adds a missing space in the " Installing x modules " log \n message that appears on node startup .
[ ML ] Mute data frame analytics BWC tests ( # 67970 ) \n Until # 67937 and # 67950 are backported to 7 . x
[ ML ] Add new hyperparams to config index mappings ( # 68103 ) \n This is a follow - up PR adding mappings for the hyperparams \n that were added in # 67950
[ ML ] Unmute explain _ data _ frame _ analytics / Test field _ selection given body ( # 68348 ) \n The test was failing in the release tests as a new parameter was added \n in the c + + side and we had to build a non - snapshot artifact for the ml - cpp \n repo . This is now done so we can unmute the test . \n Fixes # 68337
[ ML ] Mute data frame analytics BWC tests ( # 69275 ) \n Until # 69183 is backported to 7 . x
[ ML ] Do not add runtime section to DFA dest index mappings unnecessarily ( # 69329 ) \n Since config runtime mappings were added to data frame analytics jobs \n in # 69183 , when we create the destination index we add a ` runtime ` \n section in its mappings regardless of whether the job config contains \n any runtime fields . This causes failures in the BWC tests when in a \n mixed cluster where there are nodes versioned before runtime fields \n were introduced . \n This is the first part of the fix were we do not create a ` runtime ` section \n in the destination index mappings unless necessary .
Mute testCreateAndRestoreSearchableSnapshot ( # 69337 ) \n . . . in SearchableSnapshotsIntegTests . \n Relates # 69336
Mute TimeSeriesLifecycleActionsIT . testAllocateOnlyAllocation ( # 69341 ) \n Relates # 69340
Mute ShrinkActionIT . testShrinkDuringSnapshot ( # 69342 ) \n Relates # 69325
[ ML ] Remove unused method in TransportStartDataFrameAnalyticsAction ( # 68409 ) \n Removes method ` searchStoredProgress ` which is now unused as we retrieve \n progress via a call in the _ stats API .

# 7695 no need to manually release chunk during upload ( # 7696 ) \n Motivation : \n After # 7527 fix there is no need to manually release chunks ( HttpData ) during file upload as they will be released on HttpPostRequestDecoder . destroy ( ) . \n Modification : \n HttpUploadServer example doesn ' t release chunks manually ( doesn ' t call data . release ( ) ) . \n Result : \n Fixes # 7695 and # 7689
remove unnecessary vararg argument in PooledByteBufAllocator ( # 8338 ) \n Motivation : \n No need in varargs , the method always accepts array . \n Modification : \n . . . replaced with [ ]
deprecate own ConcurrentSet for removal ( # 8340 ) \n Motivation : \n Java since version 6 has the wrapper for the ConcurrentHashMap that could be created via Collections . newSetFromMap ( map ) . So no need to create own ConcurrentSet class . Also , since netty plans to switch to Java 8 soon there is another method for that - ConcurrentHashMap . newKeySet ( ) . \n For now , marking this class @ deprecated would be enough , just to warn users who use netty ' s ConcurrentSet . After switching to Java 8 ConcurrentSet should be removed and replaced with ConcurrentHashMap . newKeySet ( ) . \n Modification : \n ConcurrentSet deprecated .
deprecate IntegerHolder for removal ( # 8339 ) \n Motivation : \n Seems like IntegerHolder counterHashCode field is the very old legacy field that is no longer used . Should be marked as deprecated and removed in the future versions . \n Modification : \n IntegerHolder class , InternalThreadLocalMap . counterHashCode ( ) and InternalThreadLocalMap . setCounterHashCode ( IntegerHolder counterHashCode ) are now deprecated .
Added Automatic - Module - Name for native modules to support Java 9 modules \n Motivation : \n Latest netty missing predefined Automatic - Module - Name module name entry in MANIFEST . MF for native transports . \n Modification : \n Added Automatic - Module - Name entry to manifest during native transports build . \n Fixes [ # 7501 ]
added overloaded method to the DefaultChannelPipeline in order to avoid unnecessary allocation \n Motivation : \n Avoid unnecessary array allocation when using the function with varargs in the DefaultChannelPipeline class . \n Modifications : \n Added addLast and addFirst overloaded methods with 1 handler instead of varargs . \n Result : \n No array allocation when using simple construction like pipeline . addLast ( new Handler ( ) ) ;
Motivation : \n Since 3 . 1 . 1 mqtt protocol version SUBACK message can now indicate the failure in payload . \n Modification : \n Do not erase failure payload in for SUBACK message . \n Result : \n Fixes # 7665
# 7285 Improved " Discarded inbound message " warning ( # 9286 ) \n Motivation : \n On servers with many pipelines or dynamic pipelines , it is easy for end user to make mistake during pipeline configuration . Current message : \n ` Discarded inbound message PooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf ( ridx : 0 , widx : 2 , cap : 2 ) that reached at the tail of the pipeline . Please check your pipeline configuration . ` \n Is not always meaningful and doesn ' t allow to find the wrong pipeline quickly . \n Modification : \n Added additional log placeholder that identifies pipeline handlers and channel info . This will allow for the end users quickly find the problem pipeline . \n Result : \n Meaningful warning when the message reaches the end of the pipeline . Fixes # 7285

[ Build ] Fix gradle tests filter for JUnit 5 \n There is an a optimization in our ` projectTest ` config which filters \n out some compiled test classes if they didn ' t contain specified test \n ( if user ran : test task with - - tests flag ) . This optimization for one \n tests left only one . class file which contains test . But JUnit 5 for \n tests in inner classes ( with @ Nested annotation ) requires not only \n target class , but and all it ' s containers \n Test : package . SomeTest $ Nested . testMethod \n JUnit4 : package / SomeTest $ Nested . class \n JUnit5 : \n - package / SomeTest . class \n - package / SomeTest $ Nested . class

[ Test ] Drop duplicating ` Constructor ` typealias
[ Test ] Add @ JvmMultifileClass to coroutine helpers files \n This is needed to keep compatibility with old format , when all those \n helpers were generated dynamically on test run in one file , so \n you can reference helpers methods from java code just importing \n ` helpers . CoroutineUtilKt `
[ Test ] Remove redundant empty ` IGNORE _ BACKEND ` directive
[ Test ] Filter out ` support ` module with coroutine helpers from module deps \n In old tests coroutine helpers was added as separate module named ` support ` \n instead of additional files for current module . \n So to safe compatibility with old testdata we need to filter this dependency

[ Debugger ] Fix compiler option for disabling IR backend in tests
[ Test ] Add workaround for KT - 44359
[ Test ] Add ability to specify directive for test file \n Rules of directives resolving : \n - If no ` MODULE ` or ` FILE ` was declared in test then all directives \n belongs to module \n - If ` FILE ` is declared , then all directives after it will belong to \n file until next ` FILE ` or ` MODULE ` directive will be declared \n - All directives between ` MODULE ` and ` FILE ` directives belongs to module \n - All directives before first ` MODULE ` are global and belongs to each \n declared module
[ Test ] Support invoking ` box ` method in BB tests in separate process
[ Test ] Read default target version from sys property in new test infra
[ Test ] Allow facades to return null which indicates that facade can ' t complete it ' s job \n This is needed for cases when test pipeline assumes that some part of \n pipeline may be unavailable because of errors on previous stage . \n For example , this may occur in some test which check something on IR \n but contains backend facade for compiling binary dependencies . In \n this case testdata with frontend errors is allowed if test has only \n one module which should not be compiled

[ Test ] Fix FirIdenticalChecker and update some FIR _ IDENTICAL testdata
[ Test ] Fix OutOfMemoryError during extracting meta info from test \n Previously CodeMetaInfoParser saved MatchResults for each meta info in \n text ( and for each meta info it was different string with text because \n of extracting parsed part from original text ) , so it led to O ( n ^ 2 ) \n memory complexity ( where n is a size of original text ) . \n Such complexity caused OOME in case of big testdata ( ~ 1k meta infos \n for text of 4k lines )
[ Test ] Fix default jps ` [ JSP ] Fast FIR tests ` run configuration
[ Test ] Set static field with application to null after tests are completed
[ Test ] Align lines in TestFile with lines in real testdata file

[ Test ] Properly dispose class loader for running BB tests
[ Test ] Fix bug with FirCfgDumpHandler which didn ' t start at all \n Flag ` alreadyDumped ` is needed due to the fact that CFG dumper is not \n prepared to multimodule tests yet , so in such test this handler \n dumps only first module to . dot file . \n I forgot to switch it to ` true ` when it was introduced , so this checker \n actually , didn ' t handle anything at all

KT - 44378 don ' t generate no - arg constructor for sealed classes
Minor : load FALLBACK built - ins in JvmPlatformAnalyzerServices \n It doesn ' t matter because this built - ins instance will be used only to \n get names of default imports , so nothing can be resolved to those \n built - ins = > no diagnostics will be reported
Use all participated compilations for source - sets platform detection even in non - HMPP
Remove useless condition \n Note that in previous line we already check for ! isHmppEnabled and for \n sourceSet . name = = KotlinSourceSet . COMMON _ TEST _ SOURCE _ SET _ NAME , and if it \n holds , then we continue to the next loop iteration . So , this conditional \n here is essentually equal to ' false '
Remove useless function \n Looks like it has been broken by 40633768bc6c724bbf8cf2c5db4ee1cd8137f5f1 \n where ' KotlinCompilation . dependencies ' switched its type from \n KotlinDependency ( which is alias to \n org . jetbrains . plugins . gradle . model . ExternalDependency ) to \n KotlinDependencyId ( which is alias to Long ) , leading to safe - cast in the \n ' reportUnresolvedDependencies ' to be always evaluated to ' null ' \n Rationale for removing it completely instead of fixing : \n No one has noticed that this function has been broken + I haven ' t \n managed to find any user - visible behaviour it adds ( tried fixing it and \n checking project similar to one from \n NewMultiplatformProjectImportingTest . testUnresolved , no difference for \n me ) .

Set selection to end of text input on accessibility click \n Summary : \n When we render a text input that already has a text value ( < TextInput value = " 123 " / > ) , its selection ( cursor ) is automatically set to the end of the text . However , when you swipe to focus the text input with TalkBack , Android decides it needs to clear the selection , which moves the cursor back to the beginning of the text input . This is probably not what you want if you ' re editing some text that ' s already there . Ideally we would just keep the selection at the end , but I don ' t know how to prevent this from happening - it seems to be part of how TextView handles the accessibility focus event ? So instead I ' m just explicitly setting the selection to the end of the text in our handler for accessibility click . \n Changelog : [ Android ] [ Fixed ] Move selection to the end of the text input on accessibility click \n Reviewed By : mdvacca \n Differential Revision : D23441077 \n fbshipit - source - id : 16964f5b106637e55a98c6b0ef0f0041e8e6215d
Add support for bridgeless mode to UIManagerHelper . getUIManager ( ) \n Summary : \n ` UIManagerHelper . getUIManager ( ) ` relies on the bridge ( CatalystInstance ) to get the proper UIManager depending on which renderer is being used .

Add bridgeless check so that we notify listeners if activity is already resumed \n Summary : \n When a native module registers itself as a lifecycle event listener , ReactContext will immediately call ` onHostResume ` if the activity is already in a resumed state . We rely on this behavior for things like NativeAnimatedModule , which only enqueues the frame callback in onHostResume . However , ReactContext only does this if ` hasActiveCatalystInstance ( ) ` returns true - which makes sense , because we don ' t want to notify listeners if the instance has been destroyed . But in bridgeless mode , ` hasActiveCatalystInstance ` returns false , and we never call ` onHostResume ` in this case . \n This diff fixes an issue where native driver animations don ' t work the first time you navigate to a screen with bridgeless mode enabled . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : mdvacca \n Differential Revision : D22560314 \n fbshipit - source - id : 1a60cb482896308e21d6e438eb9a7314f580ad04

Automatically detect shaded packagePrefix \n Motivation : \n Shading requires renaming binary components ( . so , . dll ; for tcnative , \n epoll , etc ) . But the rename then requires setting the \n io . netty . packagePrefix system property on the command line or runtime , \n which is either a burden or not feasible . \n If you don ' t rename the binary components everything appears to \n work , until a dependency on a second version of the binary component is \n added . At that point , only one version of the binary will be loaded . . . \n which is what shading is supposed to prevent . So for valid shading , the \n binaries must be renamed . \n Modifications : \n Automatically detect the package prefix by comparing the actual class \n name to the non - shaded expected class name . The expected class name must \n be obfuscated to prevent shading utilities from changing it . \n Result : \n When shading and using binary components , runtime configuration is no \n longer necessary . \n Pre - existing shading users that were not renaming the binary components \n will break , because the packagePrefix previously defaulted to " " . Since \n these pre - existing users had broken configurations that only _ appeared _ \n to work , this breakage is considered a Good Thing . Users may workaround \n this breakage temporarily by setting - Dio . netty . packagePrefix = to \n restore packagePrefix to " " . \n Fixes # 6963

Delete temporary self - signed certs in SSLEngineTest - based tests \n Motivation : \n Lots of usages of SelfSignedCertificates were not deleting the certs at \n the end of the test . This includes setupHandlers ( ) which is used by \n extending classes . Although these files will be deleted at JVM exit and \n deleting them early does not free the JVM from trying to delete them at \n shutdown , it ' s good practice to delete eagerly and since users sometimes \n use tests as a form of documentation , it ' d be good for them to see the \n explicit deletes . \n Modifications : \n Add missing delete ( ) calls to ½ of the SelfSignedCertificates - using \n tests . \n Result : \n Tests that more clearly communicates which resources are created and \n may accumulate without early delete .

And thus recent versions of Conscrypt fail to enable things \n like ALPN with Netty . \n Modifications : \n Instead of calling Conscrypt . Engines . isConscrypt , call \n Conscrypt . isConscrypt . \n Result : \n Conscrypt detected properly at runtime .

Fixed JMH ByteBuf benchmark to avoid dead code elimination \n Motivation : \n The JMH doc suggests to use BlackHoles to avoid dead code elimination hence would be better to follow this best practice . \n Modifications : \n Each benchmark method is returning the ByteBuf / ByteBuffer to avoid the JVM to perform any dead code elimination . \n Result : \n The results are more reliable and comparable to the others provided by other ByteBuf benchmarks ( eg HeapByteBufBenchmark )
ByteBufInputStream is always allocating a StringBuilder instance ( # 8347 ) \n Motivation : \n Avoid creating any StringBuilder instance if \n ByteBufInputStream : : readLine isn ' t used \n Modifications : \n The StringBuilder instance is lazy allocated on demand and \n are added new test case branches to address the increased \n complexity of ByteBufInputStream : : readLine \n Result : \n Reduced GC activity if ByteBufInputStream : : readLine isn ' t used

Propagate instrumented files for transitive sources of ` android _ library ` and ` android _ binary ` \n RELNOTES : Propagate instrumented files for transitive sources of ` android _ library ` and ` android _ binary ` \n BEGIN _ PUBLIC \n When Flutter applications are instrumented with ` android _ instrumentation _ test ` , non - Java source files cannot be instrumented . This is because these transitive source files are not propagated in the dependency tree in two places : \n ( simplified ) \n ` ` ` \n < flutter assets > < - android _ library ( 1 ) < - android _ binary < - instruments - android _ binary ( 2 ) < - android _ instrumentation _ test \n ` ` ` \n 1 . ` android _ library ` does not propagate instrumented files from its dependencies \n 2 . ` android _ binary ` does not propagate instrumented files from the ` instruments ` attr \n As a result , ` android _ instrumentation _ test ` cannot access the instrumented files of the ` android _ binary ` , and the generated COVERAGE _ MANIFEST will be empty . This CL addresses the above issues by fixing the chain to propagate the instrumented files . \n This is not a problem for Java instrumented files in ` android _ instrumentation _ test ` , because of the lcov _ merger has a special rule for Java source code – they do not need to be included in the COVERAGE _ MANIFEST [ 1 ] . \n END _ PUBLIC \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 341718948

Correct documentation for filegroup . data \n It ' s true that filegroup . data ends up in the consumer ' s runfiles when consumed via the data attribute , but that ' s also true for filegroup . srcs . The point of filegroup . data is that it provides stuff that ' s used by whatever is in filegroup . srcs at runtime , and thus should be included in runfiles whether or not filegroup . srcs itself is supposed to end up in runfiles . \n For example , if filegroup . srcs contains source code , filegroup . data might contain things that the code expects to find in runfiles when it is executed . If such a filegroup target is depended on via a native rule ' s srcs attribute , filegroup . data ends up in the consumer ' s runfiles , but filegroup . srcs does not . ( If such a filegroup target is depended on via a native rule ' s data attribute , both filegroup . srcs and filegroup . data end up in the consumer ' s runfiles . ) \n Some of the wording is made a little more direct , e . g . " will be considered belonging to " - > " is added to " . \n Suggest including srcs in the attributes runfiles are merged from in Starlark rules , so that including filegroups in srcs works as expected if those filegroups have data . This is consistent with how native rules behave . \n RENOTES : None . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 344796745

Make UnpooledUnsafeHeapByteBuf class public ( # 9184 ) \n Motivation : \n 1 . Users will be able to use an optimized version of \n ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf ` and override behavior of methods if required . \n 2 . Consistency with ` UnpooledDirectByteBuf ` , ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf ` , and \n ` UnpooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf ` . \n Modifications : \n - Add ` public ` access modifier to ` UnpooledUnsafeHeapByteBuf ` class and \n ctor ; \n Result : \n Public access for optimized version of ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf ` .
Use ` AppendableCharSequence . charAtUnsafe ( int ) ` in ` HttpObjectDecoder ` ( # 9492 ) \n Motivation : \n ` HttpObjectDecoder ` pre - checks that it doesn ' t request characters \n outside of the ` AppendableCharSequence ` ' s length . ` 0 ` is always allowed \n because the minimal length of ` AppendableCharSequence ` is ` 1 ` . We can \n legally skip index check by using \n ` AppendableCharSequence . charAtUnsafe ( int ) ` in all existing cases in \n ` HttpObjectDecoder ` . \n Modifications : \n - Use ` AppendableCharSequence . charAtUnsafe ( int ) ` instead of \n ` AppendableCharSequence . charAt ( int ) ` in ` HttpObjectDecoder ` . \n Result : \n No unnecessary index checks in ` HttpObjectDecoder ` .
Add a utility that checks if the a SslProvider supports ALPN ( # 9693 ) \n Motivation : \n We have a public utility ` OpenSsl . isAlpnSupported ( ) ` that helps users to \n check if ALPN is available for ` SslProvider . OPENSSL ` . However , we do not \n provide a similar utility for ` SslProvider . JDK ` . Therefore , users who \n configured ALPN with ` SslProvider . JDK ` will get a runtime exception at \n the time when a new connection will be created . \n Modifications : \n - Add public ` SslProvider . isAlpnSupported ( SslProvider ) ` utility method \n that returns ` true ` if the ` SslProvider ` supports ALPN ; \n - Deprecate ` OpenSsl . isAlpnSupported ( ) ` ; \n Result : \n Users can verify if their environment supports ALPN with \n ` SslProvider ` upfront ( at bootstrap ) , instead of failing with \n runtime exception when a new connection will be created .

Remove jarjar from java _ tools . \n Jarjar is an advanced processor of jar files . It can rename classes consistently within a . jar file . It is used in Jacoco deployment , renaming package of ' asm ' dependency in the Jacoco deployment jar . This is done so that ' asm ' does not clash with another version of asm that might be used in the target being " code coveraged " . \n After the deployment of java _ tools , jarjar is not used by Bazel itself . There might be downstream projects using jarjar from java _ tools . However it is a much better idea to remove jarjar from java _ tools interface , and that downstream projects depend on it directly . \n Closes # 12491 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 342819568

Force error - prone version for hermetic builds .
Upgrade to error - prone 2 . 1 . 2 .
Correct testing recommendation to not rely on subclassing .
Remove old ProGuard nonsense . \n As of API 26 the android . jar contains the classes checked by Platform and used by Platform . Java8 . And we don ' t encourage throwing checked exceptions from the service method but instead routing them through your call adapter .
Remove superfluous negative check . \n Handler does this check already since 2009 when AOSP was imported to git ( aka forever ) .
Inline Bitmap byte lookup to use support library method .
Use support library version of generic system service lookup .
Prepare version 2 . 4 . 0 .
Add ResponseBody factory overload for ByteString \n We shouldn ' t punish people with a roundtrip through byte [ ] for using a superior type !
Implement correct isDefault check for Android \n There is no ability to invoke a default method yet , but at least now you ' ll get a UOE thrown instead of it being treated as a normal service method . \n Unfortunately we can ' t test this for the same reason we don ' t test normal Java 8 functionality , it requires the language level be set to 8 and we can ' t vary the value between the main sources and test sources .
Dependency updates \n * AGP 3 . 2rc2 with aapt2 disabled explicitly \n * Kotlin 1 . 2 . 61 and JDK 8 artifact instead of JRE 8 \n * Support libs 27 . 1 . 1 \n * Truth 0 . 42
Inline createBinding into bind ( Object , View ) \n No need for the extra stack frame when the signatures are the same and the latter simply delegated to the former .
Update ProGuard rules \n - Use module name as file name to prevent conflicts \n - Ignore JSR 305 annotations \n - Clarify optimization rule
Remove OkHttpCall dependency on ServiceMethod \n Inject the necessary components for it to complete the HTTP request on its own .
Embed R8 / ProGuard rules in the jar \n These can be read automatically by R8
Move general checks out of HTTP - specific code \n These should apply regardless of whether you are using HTTP , SSE , or web sockets .
Replace ' compile ' with ' implementation ' .
Remove old annotation . \n Lint correctly infers the right thing now .
Remove single - transform lock . \n Devices have massive amounts of RAM now in proportion to the image sizes they are decoding . Also this was speculatively added without empirical data to justify its presence .
Normalize null args to empty \n There is no reason to propagate the pain of nullability throughout multiple internal types .
Compile 28 , support lib 28 , androidx 1
Work around Jetifier being a thing \n Closes # 1395
Use a dummy value to further validation optional delegation \n Prior to this other things might cause a null value . This ensures the value can only come from only place .

Revert " Work around Jetifier being a thing " \n This reverts commit e30462493097d5f1a30923c51339f8e98de3e5af .
Prepare version 2 . 0 . 2 .
Use US locale to uppercase annotation first letter
Prepare version 9 . 0 . 0 - rc3
Remove enforcement of required views in reflection backend \n Almost all of the nullabiliy annotations don ' t have runtime retention so this only causes problems . Also you ' ll get an NPE and it ' ll be obvious anyway , it just won ' t be eager .
Keep Retrofit interfaces in R8 full mode \n Because R8 does not see Proxy as a source of instances , it replaces all potential instances with null
Mark HttpException . response ( ) as nullable \n If the exception was serialized this value is not retained .
Ensure JAX - B converter closes its body on error
Tolerate null - hostile lists in public API
Test canceling a suspend invocation propagates to Call
Add some missing @ Nullable annotations to Utils
Use Throwable . addSuppressed directly \n This is available with the new minimum requirements .
Switch to Arrays . copyOf for expanding array \n This is an intrinsic in the JVM so it should have better performance .
Use copyOfRange helper \n Instead of creating and copying a subset of the array manually . This also expands the tests to ensure the original instance is returned unmodifed when no nulls are present .
Silence some ProGuard warnings we do not care about
Next version is 3 . 0 . 0 \n Also the groupId has changed .
Use Kotlin stdlib charsets for UTF - 32
Do not use public trampolines for internal functions
Rename internal file and specify non - Kt - suffixed name
Update to AGP 3 . 3 as minimum supported version

Simplfy activity logo reflection thanks to smith324 . Add useLogo method to change log .
Correctly name API method . . . idiot .
Add wrapper for a fragments activity which uses the compatibility library . At ~ 101KB , the effect should be minimal . The vast majority implementors will likely be using fragments so its added filesize would have been incured anyway .
Update sample to reflect new interface names .
Add more assertions during the build process . Actually set attached to true when attach ( ) is called .
Reorder activity base class list so the phrase ' the latter of which ' actually refers to the right class .

On pre - Honeycomb the implementation will always return ` true ` \n since it originally was designed with its own menu support .

Re - use the single empty Disposable instance everywhere . ( # 4078 )
Replace custom empty Disposables with global instance . ( # 4080 )
Do not leak the DISPOSED marker instance into public API . ( # 4081 ) \n If this were to be used by public code it could have have Very Bad™ effects by causing operators to think that they already disposed resources when they actually had not . Since ` Disposable ` is stateless it ' s safe for ` disposed ( ) ` and ` empty ( ) ` to be synonymous , although that might change in the future so both methods are retained .

Remove explicit StackOverflow check as its a VirtualMachineError . ( # 4391 ) \n Looks like [ the linked comment ] [ 1 ] was misinterpreted ( but not in a way that affected the implementation ) as Scala considered StackOverflowError as non - fatal but RxJava always considered it fatal . As such , its explicit check was redundant . \n [ 1 ] : https : / / github . com / ReactiveX / RxJava / issues / 748 # issuecomment - 32471495
Avoid potential NPE when onError throws . ( # 4398 ) \n t2 was only initialized if canceling threw an exception . In the happy path it would have never been initialized so when onError threw the call to suppress ( ) would NPE .

Restore license to correct text . ( # 5735 ) \n This section is a template on how to apply the header and not something that actually should have been changed .
Remove handler callbacks before setting disposed . \n This change ensures that you can never observe ` disposed ` being set to ` true ` inside ` run ( ) ` . ` removeCallbacks ` and the mechanism by which a ` Looper ` retrieves the head of the message queue are both governed by a lock . When ` dispose ( ) ` is called on a non - main thread taking this lock is the race which determines cancelation and * * not * * the boolean . \n Include a comment emphasizing that the boolean is tracked solely for the purposes of accurate ` isDisposed ( ) ` reporting .

HTTP - specific exception for the simple Observable case . \n When you specify a return type of Observable < ResponseType > , we need a way to propagate non - 2xx failures through the onError pipeline which accepts any Throwable .

OPTIONS allows body . \n > If the OPTIONS request includes an entity - body ( as indicated by the presence of Content - Length or Transfer - Encoding ) , then the media type MUST be indicated by a Content - Type field . Although this specification does not define any use for such a body , future extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed queries on the server .

Switch reset ( ) to @ Experimental to match RxJava .
Remove unnecessary reset . These tests don ' t use the global instance .
Fix AndroidSchedulers to create an instance using hook only once . \n Previously we were asking the hook for an instance every time ` mainThread ( ) ` was called . This not only impacted performance , but also broke the contract the that hook was a factory–instead requiring that it behave like a thread - safe , lazily - initialized instance cache . \n If for whatever reason you do need to change the instance over time , return a scheduler instance which delegates to another and allows swapping out the delegate .

Accelerate build - side geometries in spatial join \n Build gemetries are often used repeated for spatial relation checks in a \n spatial join . Accelerating a geometry is a one - time cost which reduces \n the complexity of these checks from ` O ( n ) ` to ` O ( lg n ) ` or even ` O ( 1 ) ` , \n where n is the number of vertices . When a geometry is accessed for the \n join , accelerate it ( an idempotent operation ) . \n Upgraded ESRI library to 2 . 2 . 2 ( from 2 . 2 . 1 ) to pick up a fix in \n acceleration logic .
Clarify ST _ Point documentation \n ST _ Point signature is ` double , double ` , which is not clear whether that \n should by ` latitude , longitude ` or ` longitude , latitude ` . This message \n clarifies that .
Standardize formatting of " null " \n It was formatted three different ways in this one file . Standardize \n on ` ` null ` ` .
Upgrade ESRI geometry to v2 . 2 . 3 \n Version 2 . 2 . 3 has two fixes of interest : \n correct computation of centroids of very small polygons - Esri / geometry - api - java # 227 \n correct computation of buffers around small polygons - Esri / geometry - api - java # 243
Test for ST _ Buffer NPE fix \n Upgrading to Esri 2 . 2 . 3 included the fix in Esri / geometry - api - java # 243 \n Fixes # 13194
Clarify the docs for numeric _ histogram \n From the description of numeric _ histogram , it was unclear what the \n keys and values of the returned map were . This clarifies that \n the keys are the centers of the bin , and the entries are the \n counts / total weights of the bin .
Throw exception when creating an empty spatial partition \n If the spatial partition query yielded 0 rows , an empty spatial \n partition would be made . It ' s unclear what an empty spatial partition \n is ! Correspondingly , it was serialized as null , and then caused errors \n during deserialization and use . \n This throws an exception in the case that the spatial partition \n is trying to be created with no rows .
Ignore order of rows in spatial join tests \n Spatial joins don ' t have a defined output order , so don ' t test for that .
Combine JTS Envelope tests \n In keeping with other tests , we test several cases in one .
Fix getExtent NPE for Geometry Collections \n Once again , the non - uniform behavior of ESRI Geometry Collections trips \n us up . Use our standard ( and tested ) function to get ESRI envelopes \n to create our rectangle .
Allow empty Envelope serialization \n Previously , empty envelopes were not allowed to be serialized . \n It will be useful to be able to serialize them for ST _ Expand , so \n this commit enables them .
Improve Geometry Serialization Tests \n 1 . Remove duplicate test case . \n 2 . Change serialization equality testing to be more semantic . \n JTS and ESRI have different orderings of their polygon loops \n ( clockwise and counter - clockwise ) which doesn ' t affect \n serialization / deserialization correctness , but does change the \n intermediate format . This changes the test to only care about \n the output .
Upgrade JTS to 1 . 16 . 1
Fix incorrect intersection between two envelopes \n When two envelopes intersected at a single point , the intersection would \n be incorrectly calculated as ` POINT ( x , x ) ` instead of ` POINT ( x , y ) ` . \n This also simplifies the logic when two envelopes intersect in a line .
Upgrade slice to 0 . 38 \n Previous version was 0 . 36 . There was one minor incompatibility .
Adding multilayered requests to NetworkRequestInfo \n Updating NetworkRequestInfo for " multilayered requests " functionality so that \n requests can support a network hierarchy . I . e . , requests network \n with capability A first and if not available , request network with \n capability B .

Reduce Memory used by Finished AsyncQueue Instances \n ArrayDeque instances have no way to shrink their backing array \n which can grow large during query execution and is retained by way \n of references in QueryTracker after completion . This resets the \n AsyncQueue elements field after finishing to reduce heap usage .
Prefer Files . newInputStream / Files . newOutputStream \n File { Input , Output } Stream overrides the finalizer which can keep \n instances alive longer and lead to longer GC pause cycles . This is \n fixed for newer JDK releases , but still affects JDK 8 users .
Remove Unused Argument in ParquetPageSource \n Remove unused effectivePredicate in ParquetPageSource constructor .
Fix Parquet Predicate Pushdown on Dictionaries \n Commit 0f7982b refactored ParquetPredicateUtils . getDictionaries from \n getDictionariesByColumnOrdinal , removing a nested loop iteration but \n accidentally leaving in a break statement . The effect has been that \n at most 1 dictionary was returned from getDictionaries , limiting the \n effectiveness of predicate pushdown on dictionaries .
Refactor TableScanOperator stats collection \n Reorganizes TableScanOperator stats collection to match the changes \n made to ScanFilterAndProjectOperator .
Allow hive outstanding splits size limit larger than 2GB \n The hive . max - outstanding - splits - size configuration passed into \n HiveSplitSource was previously stored as an int , prohibiting values \n > = 2GB to be used . Switching the representation to long removes the \n unnecessary restriction .
Remove unnecessary copies in StreamingAggregationOperator \n The previous implementation copied the aggregation group out of the \n page for each aggregation operator which is wasteful and extremely \n slow when the number of aggregates performed is large . \n Performance improvement depends on the number of aggregations and \n the number of groups contained in the page , but some workloads can \n improve throughput by more than 100 % and generate significantly \n less garbage
Optimize parquet gzip decompression \n Avoids creating an intermediate buffer and copy from buffer to \n DynamicSliceOutput in parquet gzip decompression . Also avoids \n allocating the full 8k gzip input buffer size when the slice input \n is smaller . Finally , a validation check is added to verify the \n uncompressedSize is correct whereas previously the resulting slice \n would contain garbage data at the end ( likely zeroed memory ) .
Remove usage of String . format in HTTP client hot path \n Avoids the use of String . format from the trace token request filter \n to avoid unnecessary allocations and worse performance in the http \n client hot path . Allocation profiles showed this as representing \n one percent of all worker allocations ( by number of allocations , \n not proportional to size ) while queries were running . After this \n change , it represents ~ 0 . 2 % .
Reduce LazyBlock copy / wrapping in ScanFilterAndProjectOperator \n Previously , LazyBlock instances that were already loaded would \n still be wrapped in a new LazyBlock that reported statistics on \n load . Now , only not - yet - loaded LazyBlock instances will require \n that wrapping . Additionally , when no changes to the Page blocks \n are required , the original page can be reused when recording input
Add status endpoint for HTTP HEAD requests \n Previously , node pings in HeartbeatFailureDetector would go to the \n root path and return 404 from workers because no endpoint was mapped \n to handle them . Now the failure detector points to / v1 / status \n and receives empty HTTP OK responses instead .
Use shared metrics collector in PestoS3ClientFactory \n Previously , an instance of PrestoS3FileSystemStats instance was \n created in PrestoS3ClientFactory which means it would not report \n S3 client stats to the instance registered with JMX . This would \n only have affected PrestoS3Select clients . Now the same metric \n instance is shared with PrestoS3FileSystem
Handle empty and arbitrary slices in Parquet reader
Add copyPositions and extractChannels utility methods to Page
Add Page # extractChannel ( int ) to enable efficient single channel extraction
Clamp BackgroundHiveSplitLoader concurrency to usable parallelism \n Avoids allocation a greater level of concurrency to split loading \n than can actually be used based on the number of partititions being \n loaded . The effective usable concurrency in split loading can be \n significantly lower than the configured split loader concurrency \n value when the number of partitions scanned is small since each \n partition will be loaded by at most 1 thread at a time . \n This change makes it feasible to configure a much higher concurrency \n value than before without overcommitting threads to loading tasks \n that provide no additional actual parallelism .
Add Page constructor for empty blocks case \n Avoids varargs empty array creation per call for these usage sites
Fix potential deadlock when PageBufferClient exceeds memory limit \n Prior to this change , if the PageBufferClient caused a task to exceed \n its memory limit inside of addPages , the exception would bubble to the \n root of the exchange client callback executor without ever marking the \n task as failed . If no other operator also saw the memory limit \n exceeded condition , then the task would become stuck in a deadlocked \n state .
Avoid DateTimeZone . getDefault ( ) in GenericHiveRecordCursor hot path
Remove synchronized for final field read in MemoryPool # getMaxBytes ( )
Fix accidental per - instance logger in SerializedPageWriteListener
Avoid repeatedly setting memory limits in QueryContext \n Synchronizing on the QueryContext as part of every task update adds \n contention to the already heavily contended QueryContext instance \n ( since each memory tracking update must synchronize as well ) . This \n change checks whether the memory limit initialization is necessary \n before synchronizing to avoid adding the extra contention after they \n have been set at least once successfully .
Add SqlTask # getTaskState ( ) and SqlTask # getTaskCreateTime ( ) \n Avoids using comparatively more expensive methods like getTaskStats ( ) \n or getTaskStatus ( ) when only these specific fields are required and \n no particular synchronization order is being enforced .

Don ' t minify JS bundle by default when using hermes ( # 30496 ) \n Summary : \n Minification is not needed for hermes as it does all required optimisations on the bytecode .

Make dependencies cache more reliable on CI ( # 30534 ) \n Summary : \n I was looking into why CI was failing and could not reproduce locally , also noticed the errors seemed to come from old version of files being used , for example a missing symbol added in a JSI commit ~ 1 month ago . I noticed that we were using multiple cache keys for a lot of deps in the following format : \n ` ` ` \n - v3 - pods - { { . Environment . CIRCLE _ JOB } } - { { checksum " packages / rn - tester / Podfile . lock . bak " } } \n - v3 - pods - { { . Environment . CIRCLE _ JOB } } - \n ` ` ` \n This means that if the cache doesn ' t exist for the checksum of the lockfile it will get one for any other checksum . This can lead to loading old version of files that cocoapod / yarn probably doesn ' t detect and keeps instead of getting the proper version . To make things worst it then caches the broken dep package after . \n This removes all of these key fallbacks and use the cache only if we have a perfect match . This should make CI more reliable and fix random breaks after updating deps / pod configs . \n # # Changelog \n [ Internal ] [ Fixed ] - Make dependencies cache more reliable on CI \n Pull Request resolved : https : / / github . com / facebook / react - native / pull / 30534 \n Test Plan : \n - Check that tests now pass when cache is bypassed \n - Check that it still passes with cache \n - Hope the issue stops happening the next time someone updates deps : ) \n Reviewed By : fkgozali \n Differential Revision : D25326131 \n Pulled By : hramos \n fbshipit - source - id : f21cdfca7b2456ac0edbdcce3f9eb0a828a9b977

Do not treat errors as decoder exception \n Motivation : Today when Netty encounters a general error while decoding \n it treats this as a decoder exception . However , for fatal causes this \n should not be treated as such , instead the fatal error should be carried \n up the stack without the callee having to unwind causes . \n Modifications : Instead of translating any error to a decoder exception , \n we let those unwind out the stack ( note that finally blocks still \n execute ) . \n Result : Fatal errors will not be treated as innocent decoder exceptions .

Relax handling of Cache - Control : immutable \n Previously we were treating this header as if the response would never \n change . This was incorrect .

Add README instructions for using JAR files from Stetho ' s build system \n Without Maven repository support , the integration steps are a little \n more involved , requiring developers to build the artifacts locally and \n copy / rename them into their project ' s ` libs / ` directory . It is also \n required to reference ` commons - cli ` manually because there is no \n dependency resolution when dealing with jar files . \n This can be simplified greatly once the project is fully open by \n uploading artifacts to Maven central or BinTray ' s jcenter .
Add scripts / _ _ pycache _ _ to . gitignore \n This directory appears to be created each time I run ` . / scripts / dumpapp ` . \n That ' s annoying : )
Handle SIGPIPE gracefully in . / scripts / dumpapp \n A broken pipe can be observed by scripting commands as in : \n . / scripts / dumpapp printforever | head - 1 \n Though the intended behaviour is to have dumpapp die early and report \n success as ` head ` in this case has caused the pipe to be broken on \n purpose .
Add androidJavadocJar archive \n This is a requirement for uploading to Maven Central .
Add jarDebug / Release tasks to simplify release deployment \n Releases include JAR files uploaded in the github releases system which \n are clumsy to extract from the AAR files . With this new task , it is \n easier to do a release using just ` gradle uploadArchives jarRelease ` and \n then uploading the resulting jar files ( base + javadoc + sources jar )
Comply with Maven Central policies \n Add developers , description , and use interval ranges instead of ' + ' .
Update README to refer to Maven / Gradle deployment
Add fatjarRelease task to fix stetho . jar export \n Release fail . The stetho - 1 . 0 . 0 . jar that was released excludes \n commons - cli and will fail as a result . This dependency is so esoteric \n for an Android app that it feels appropriate to just bundle it .
Fix duplicate dumpapp endpoints for a single process \n stetho _ open . py naively assumes any entry matching @ stetho _ * represents a \n bound server socket , however this is not true . Connected client sockets \n will also appear with different flags and in a different state . Filter \n based on this criteria to only identify server sockets . \n Closes # 37
Optimize Travis - CI builds by caching Gradle / Maven artifacts \n These artifacts are those downloaded as part of the dynamic build \n process and which don ' t change regularly .
Break the bindToSocket retry loop on success \n This caused all invocations to print a stack trace indicating a serious \n sounding error when in fact everything was working fine . Added a log \n statement to clarify that everything is fine : ) \n Closes # 49
Bump to 1 . 0 . 1 - SNAPSHOT . \n Should ' ve done this as part of the initial 1 . 0 . 0 release . Will need to \n automate the release process soon .
Avoid sending a null ` type ` or ` mimeType ` in network responses \n DevTools refuses to show any entry that lacks the ` type ` property in \n recent versions . This makes it possible to inspect network responses \n that for whatever reason don ' t have the ` Content - Type ` header available . \n Closes # 57
Stop using Travis - CI cache \n This just doesn ' t optimize things with Gradle due to the lock file being \n changed in ~ / . gradle / caches on each build . Disable for now ; hopefully \n Travis - CI will fix this .
Use raw process name for UNIX abstract socket name \n Previously we formatted the process name using underscores due to \n primitive tooling that has since been replaced . We can now use the real \n process name which fixes an issue with . / scripts / dumpapp output when \n there are multiple targets that include derivative processes \n ( com . mypackage : myprocess ) . Previously this would show up as \n com . mypackage . myprocess .
Add process name to chrome : / / inspect UI \n This makes it possible to distinguish multiple processes from the same \n application . The information is also confirmed in the Console tab after \n the DevTools attaches . \n Closes # 65
Fix confusing LICENSE issue in fatjar release \n The fatjar release for 1 . 0 . 0 automatically merged commons - cli ' s \n LICENSE . txt file into the base META - INF directory , appearing to replace \n our own LICENSE with the Apache 2 . 0 license . Very bad : ) \n This corrects the situation by somewhat manually organizing the \n dependencies into the following structure : \n META - INF / \n META - INF / commons - cli - LICENSE . txt \n META - INF / commons - cli - NOTICE . txt \n META - INF / LICENSE \n META - INF / MANIFEST . MF \n META - INF / maven / \n META - INF / maven / commons - cli / \n META - INF / maven / commons - cli / commons - cli / \n META - INF / maven / commons - cli / commons - cli / pom . properties \n META - INF / maven / commons - cli / commons - cli / pom . xml

Update README with mention of ` StethoURLConnectionManager ` .
Workaround serious throughput issue in Stetho ' s HTTP server \n All communication between host and Stetho is done by a LocalSocket ( a \n UNIX abstract domain socket ) which has a very heavy - handed \n implementation of LocalSocketImpl # flush which polls / sleeps waiting for \n the kernel buffer to become empty . This behaviour in practice reduces \n observed throughput of dumpapp ( using either the buffered stdout or \n stderr ) to between 300 and 600KB / s despite adb being capable of ~ 5MB / s \n on the same device . \n This workaround involves blocking the final flush call to the socket \n output stream . This still drains the local Java buffer as originally \n intended , but does not ask the kernel to drain its buffer ( and block \n doing so ) . This kernel draining behaviour is entirely unnecessary for \n our purposes and presumably for everyone else as it appears to be added \n for some special purpose hack in the Bluetooh implementation .
Don ' t sleep forever in ` dumpapp crash throw ` \n Wait on the crash thread instead , which will appropriately block the \n command line until the crash is acknowledged by Android and takes down \n the process . Tested this with : \n former = Thread . getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler ( ) ; \n Thread . setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler ( ( . . . ) - > { \n Thread . sleep ( 5000 ) ; \n former . uncaughtException ( . . . ) ; \n } ) ; \n This caused ` dumpapp crash throw ` to hang for 5 seconds before the \n process crashed and then the control was returned to the command line as \n expected . \n Separately , not invoking former . uncaughtException caused the process to \n continue running , and ` dumpapp crash throw ` returns immediately ( as \n it should even if counter intuitively ) .
Change version to 1 . 2 . 0 - SNAPSHOT \n This was supposed to be done after 1 . 1 . 1 was cut but I must have forgot . \n Sigh , we need to bring in the gradle release plugin : )
Fix issue that can hide slow network requests \n WebKit Inspector contains an apparent implementation bug whereby if the \n request does not provide a Page . ResourceType guess then it will hide it \n from the UI until Network . responseReceived is delivered with the actual \n Page . ResourceType is given . This works fine when there is a small delay \n between requestWillBeSent and responseReceived , but if the delay widens \n significantly , the Inspector UI will discard the record and fail to show \n it no matter how progress is made after that point . \n This can be demonstrated by adding significant timing delays in network \n events ( such as by using iptables to slow down or stop traffic entirely ) \n or just adding delays in NetworkEventReporterImpl .
Work around an issue causing network requests to disappear from the UI \n This works around an apparent upstream bug in which a new undocumented \n field which , if not added , will cause a JavaScript error to occur in the \n UI and the row will be removed during Network . loadingFailed . This \n appears to be a related regression to that fixes in PR # 10 .
Properly encode multiple headers with the same name \n Unspecified in the protocol docs , we ' re expected to separate multiple \n header values with the same name using a new line character . This is \n necessary because a normal JSON object cannot have the same name \n repeated twice ( and headers are encoded using a JSON object not an \n array ) . \n Closes # 115
Add ` - p < process > ` option to scripts / hprof _ dump . sh \n This allows a caller to respect the advice given by the error message \n ( " Use - p to select a process . . . " ) . Also fix an issue where those error \n messages would not be displayed correctly to the user by way of my \n terrible misunderanding of Python3 .
Fix FragmentActivity class equality issue \n It must be isInstance else it would require that the Activity actually \n be FragmentActivity directly . This does not occur in practice , of \n course .

Avoid installing the DOM module when Activity detection is unavailable \n The DOM module effectively doesn ' t work due to our hack that lists all \n activities not functioning properly on previous versions of Android . \n Without this , we currently cannot provide the DOM feature . \n We can fix these issues by providing a manual API that informs us of \n activity lifecycle events similar to Romain Guy ' s ViewServer : \n https : / / github . com / romainguy / ViewServer

Fix minor gotchas in DOM . resolveNode \n Closes # 170
Fix crash when the support library is present but not used for a particular Activity . \n This is done by simply checking whether we have an instance of \n FragmentActivity before taking the support library path .

LayoutAnimations : Fix out - of - order DELETE and REMOVE instruction generation \n Summary : \n In very marginal cases , it was possible to set up an animation of the following diffing instructions : \n ` ` ` \n REMOVE X from parent Y \n DELETE X \n ` ` ` \n If your LayoutAnimation configuration had no " delete " config , the DELETE would be executed immediately ; the REMOVE was erroneously being categorized as an " update " ( now fixed ) \n which caused the REMOVE to be delayed , but then executed very shortly thereafter . So the order of instructions would become : \n ` ` ` \n DELETE X \n REMOVE X from parent Y \n ` ` ` \n which would crash ( or at least fail an assertion ) when the REMOVE instruction was processed . \n This fixes the issue by ensuring that REMOVEs have a corresponding " delete " config , or they are also executed immediately ; unless followed by an INSERT ( and any combination of ` REMOVE , DELETE , INSERT ` in the same frame is not possible ) . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : sammy - SC \n Differential Revision : D25292560 \n fbshipit - source - id : 7ffdd6cbcb43126de07a70c197dfaf1ebff83555

Fix IntBufferMountItem optimization + LayoutAnimation bug \n Summary : \n The new IntBufferMountItem queueing actually enforces a global ordering of mutation types : CREATEs , then INSERT , then REMOVE , then UPDATE , then DELETE . \n See comments for more details . In general this ordering is fine , but if a DELETE animation is in progress and ( due to view unflattening ) the same view is recreated , the CREATE will be executed and then the in - process DELETE ( since conflicting animations get flushed ) . \n To mitigate this , in Binding we detect this and simply remove DELETE operations queued when we detect that we want to CREATE the node . ` DELETE . . . CREATE ` is valid but ` CREATE . . . DELETE ` in a single frame is not , so this is safe . \n This does complicate and add more assumptions to Binding than I would like , but it should unblock us for now . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : mdvacca \n Differential Revision : D26271299 \n fbshipit - source - id : 9453fe17b8b541e484a047dc9637674dbdcc8e9a

Allow to build a RecordParser without an initial output handler
motivation : currently the MessageConsumer end handler is called only when consumer is unregistered during an event bus close . When the consumer is explicitly unregistered it is not called . This handler is mainly used by RxJava and Kotlin coroutines and it seems it would be best to call the end handler in all case to give an opportunity to end the treatment . In RxJava it would call the complete handler and in Kotlin it would close the underlying channel ( so a for - each iteration on the channel would terminate and execute the code after ) . \n change : call the MessageConsumer end handler when the MessageConsumer is unregistered explictly .

Preserve the original filename when encoding a multipart / form in mixed mode . ( # 9270 ) \n Motivation : \n The HttpPostRequestEncoder overwrites the original filename of file uploads sharing the same name encoded in mixed mode when it rewrites the multipart body header of the previous file . The original filename should be preserved instead . \n Modifications : \n Change the HttpPostRequestEncoder to reuse the correct filename when the encoder switches to mixed mode . The original test is incorrect and has been modified too , in addition it tests with an extra file upload since the current test was not testing the continuation of a mixed mode . \n Result : \n The HttpPostRequestEncoder will preserve the original filename of the first fileupload when switching to mixed mode

Avoid evicting an HTTP / 2 connection from the pool multiple times
When an HTTP client request has been reset soon after it was scheduled , the client will assume that the request was sent and emit a reset event to the metrics implementation . The metrics implementation truthfully assume that a request begin event was previously emitted and it might not be the case leading to an unexpected state . We should only emit a reset event when an HTTP request object has been created . - close # 3576

Handle bytes read in a single place before deliving the message to the connection ( pretty much like it is for bytes written
Use ContextInternal # setTimer to have a timer firing on the context thread
Http1xClientConnection caches the expiration timestamp that is computed when the connection is recycled . When the connection is created by the pool but not used and immediately put back in the pool ( it can happen with a slow TCP handshake ) then the connection expiration timestamp field is not initialized and will tell the pool it is valid whatsoever . The connection remains usable like any other pooled connection however the pool policy will not apply to it ( such as pool keep - alive setting ) . \n We should initialize this field when the connection is created so the proper keep alive setting is used when the connection is not recycled when put in the pool . - see # 3692 - see # 3687

Use a tail recursion style for the event - bus Serializer task execution : the event - bus Serializer implementation dequeues using continuations which can lead to stack overflow when handling a large number of tasks when the selector always returns an already completed future . The implementation can be changed to avoid this by having the task completion to recognize that a task dequeuing is already in progress and cooperating with it .

Use simple memory context for tracking page processor memory \n When page processor produces small pages those would be merged \n together into larger pages . In such case , we shouldn ' t use \n operator memory context directly as it propagates synchronized \n ( between queries ) update up to memory pool which will throttle \n performance .
Update retained size in PageProcessor less eagerly \n Two observations : \n 1 . It is allowed to not account for the retained size of in - flight pages . \n Therefore , in PageProcessor we can get rid of the retained size calculations \n if the page is not being retained for further processing . \n 2 .

Force / usr / bin / python2 . 7 on macOS \n Because of this issue https : / / github . com / bazelbuild / bazel / issues / 12049 \n this call to python doesn ' t respect the PATH users invoke bazel with . \n Because the default shell path contains / usr / local / bin , this ` python ` \n could end up being from homebrew . Homebrew ' s python installations are \n easily borked which leads to hashlib being unusable : \n https : / / discuss . bitrise . io / t / broken - python - 2 - 7 - hashlib - in - new - xcode - 10 - 3 - x - mojave - stack / 11401 / 7 \n This changes this use case to a path that always exists ( at least for \n now ) on macOS , and only falls back to the bare executable if it doesn ' t . \n Ideally this would utilize the python version from the toolchain \n instead . \n Closes # 12072 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 335109991
Remove C + + linking from oso _ prefix feature for now \n Currently in the macOS toolchain C + + linking goes through \n ` cc _ wrapper . sh ` , not ` wrapped _ clang ` . I didn ' t add the handling to \n ` cc _ wrapper ` for this argument . These wrappers will likely go away soon , \n when they do we should probably make them route to wrapped _ clang \n instead , in which case we could revert this . \n https : / / github . com / bazelbuild / bazel / pull / 12304 \n Closes # 12356 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 340817292
Add libraries to allowed macOS include directories \n This adds macOS ` / Library ` and ` / Users / $ USER / Library ` to allowed include \n paths . In macOS workflows most system headers are included in the Xcode \n toolchains , which were already covered in this logic . The only exception \n is custom ` xctoolchains ` , which can be used for custom Swift compilers \n ( among other things ) . These toolchains are either installed globally in \n ` / Library ` , or without root they can be installed in the user ' s \n ` ~ / Library ` . This adds those paths since they can safely be referenced \n by passing ` - - action _ env = TOOLCHAINS = toolchain _ id ` which will be picked \n up by invocations of ` xcrun ` . \n Closes # 12328 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 340817483

We can do that in the future , but it ' s \n also very minor so it likely isn ' t worth breaking everyone for . \n https : / / github . com / bazelbuild / bazel / issues / 12102 \n Closes # 12103 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 331567853

Remove always failing include path searching \n Since this was run as part of the workspace setup , DEVELOPER _ DIR and \n SDKROOT are not set , which means wrapped _ clang , which was being used as \n the cc for this , will always fail . Whether or not the invocation fails \n isn ' t taken into account for the result , and the expected output was \n never produced , so this always returned nothing . \n Closes # 11711 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 338260943
Add feature to remap Xcode path in debug info \n By default the path to Xcode and the current SDK root are embedded in \n binary ' s debug info .

Add relative _ ast _ path _ feature \n This feature applies for darwin builds to disable absolutizing \n swiftmodule paths to link commands . Previously these paths were \n absolutized to support debugging . This is not required if users change \n the pwd of their debugger so that the relative paths are valid . Since we \n don ' t have a way to force that on users , absolutizing them is still the \n default , but users who configure that can enable this feature to improve \n hermeticity of their builds . \n RELNOTES : Add ` relative _ ast _ path ` feature for darwin builds to relativize swiftmodule paths for debugging \n Closes # 12285 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 338451975
Remove builtin directory file on macOS \n On macOS the paths produced in this file are specific to Xcode paths . \n Since Xcode versions are already managed by ` local _ config _ xcode ` , having \n this duplicates that validation , and also breaks caching . \n This fixes https : / / github . com / bazelbuild / bazel / issues / 10187 \n Closes # 10281 . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 338700136

Disallow NetworkAgents from changing the owner UID . \n The current behaviour with regards to changing the owner UID is \n bizarre and arguably incorrect . A NetworkAgent can change the \n owner to whatever other app it wants , regardless of signatures , \n at any time . This includes , for example , transferring ownership \n to another UID and then recovering it . \n Fortunately no existing NetworkAgent appears to do this : \n - ClientModeImpl sets it to the UID of the app that created the \n configuration . It doesn ' t look like it can change while the \n network is connected . \n - Vpn sets it to the UID of the VPN owner . That also can ' t change . \n - Telephony does not appear to set it at all , it only sets the \n administrator UIDs ( and updates them whenever it gets \n EVENT _ CARRIER _ PRIVILEGED _ UIDS _ CHANGED ) . \n Disallow this now before code is written that depends on it . \n Bug : 175188445 \n Test : modified tests in ConnectivityServiceTest \n Change - Id : I638e29fda2481ec3bf4fff562ea66a73322881df
Add a convenience method to update a network ' s capabilities . \n Almost all calls to ConnectivityService # updateCapabilities use \n all the current data in the network , and thus call the method \n like this : \n updateCapabilities ( nai . getCurrentScore ( ) , nai , nai . networkCapabilities ) ; \n Introduce a convenience method to simplify this frequent use case . \n Bug : 173331190 \n Test : passes existing ConnectivityService tests \n Change - Id : I6eb6d92bd159f2575d10a929bd59f6dd1b7a4b4e
Minor fixes to NetworkCapabilities # toString . \n 1 . The current code only prints the array of administrator UIDs \n if it ' s empty . This is clearly an oversight . Print it only if \n it ' s non - empty . \n 2 . Only print requestor UID and package name if they are set . \n This makes output shorter in the common case that they are \n unset . \n 3 . Reorder the output at the end : group all UIDs together , and \n place SSID and private DNS broken bit after that . \n 4 . Make the private DNS broken indication a single word instead \n of a sentence . This saves space and makes it easier to write \n regexps . \n New format : \n . . . SignalStrength : - 72 OwnerUid : 1000 AdminUids : [ 1000 ] SSID : . . . \n . . .

Stop accessing VPNs in checkConnectivityDiagnosticsPermissions . \n Currently , checkConnectivityDiagnosticsPermissions takes the VPN \n lock to examine the VPN ' s underlying networks .

Make testVpnNetworkActive more deterministic . \n This test is a bit brittle because it sets the underlying \n networks while the VPN is undergoing validation by \n NetworkMonitor . The test does attempt to disable validation , \n but that ' s not actually possible - the only thing that ' s possible \n is to tell NetworkMonitor to validate immediately without sending \n any probes . So the underlying network change races with the \n validation . I ' m not sure why the test isn ' t flaky . It might be \n because both the network change and the validation result in a \n capabilities change , and the test expects " a capabilities change " \n without expressing what change that should be . \n Make this a bit more predictable by ensuring that the network \n validates before the underlying networks are set . \n This is useful because an upcoming CL will change the way \n underlying network capabilities are propagated . With this test \n CL , both the old and the new code pass . \n Bug : 173331190 \n Test : test - only change \n Change - Id : I319858228e8d097c0b60a107029f296385f91269

More cleanly separate requests and listens . \n Currently , NetworkRequest has several types of requests ( LISTEN , \n TRACK _ DEFAULT , REQUEST , BACKGROUND _ REQUEST ) , and we expect more \n to be added . \n There are really three categories of request : \n 1 . Requests satisfied by only one network and will keep that \n network up , and thus need to be sent to NetworkProviders : \n REQUEST , BACKGROUND _ REQUEST . \n 2 . Requests satisfied by only one network but will not keep that \n network up : TRACK _ DEFAULT \n 3 . Requests satisfied by multiple networks and will not keep any \n networks up : LISTEN . \n Unfortunately the separation is not very clear . Currently , for \n any valid request , either isListen ( ) will return true or \n isRequest ( ) will return true . This makes it impossible to tell \n whether a particular request should be sent to NetworkProviders , \n so the current code sends TRACK _ DEFAULT requests to \n NetworkProviders as well . This is incorrect - a TRACK _ DEFAULT \n should never keep a network up , for example . \n This CL attempts to clarify things by making isRequest ( ) return \n false for TRACK _ DEFAULT requests and thus never sending them to \n NetworkProviders . After this CL : \n - isRequest will return true only for requests that attempt to \n bring up or keep up a network . \n - isListen will return true only for requests that match multiple \n networks but do not keep any of them up . \n - Neither will return true for TRACK _ DEFAULT . \n Test : atest ConnectivityServiceTest \n Change - Id : I7aad30ade8f7ab2a179e53483d9afd8675f64a12

Allow setting underlying networks when legacy lockdown enabled . \n Currently , if a legacy lockdown VPN is up , no VPN can set \n underlying networks . This does not make much sense . \n When legacy lockdown VPN is enabled , no other VPN is allowed to \n call prepare ( ) or establish ( ) , so no other VPN can connect , and \n if no VPN can connect , then no VPN can set underlying networks . \n Therefore , disabling the ability to set underlying networks only \n affects the legacy lockdown VPN itself . \n This change is necessary because in a future CL , the legacy \n lockdown VPN will start to inform ConnectivityService of its \n underlying network . \n Bug : 173331190 \n Test : tests in subsequent CLs in stack \n Change - Id : Ifa2aa3351c2c8324571f96fda151864ed987ed5a

Isolate an ad - hoc legacy API codepath . \n The legacy API getNetworkInfo ( int type ) is expected to return \n NetworkInfo objects for all network types supported by the device \n even when those network types are not connected . \n This requires a lot of fabrication because all the data \n structures in ConnectivityService store information about \n connected networks , not networks that don ' t exist . \n Worse , the current behaviour is to return BLOCKED instead of \n DISCONNECTED if background data is restricted . This obviously \n makes no sense , because a disconnected network cannot be \n blocked , and because if that network type did connect and was \n unmetered ( e . g . , Wi - Fi ) , it would no longer be BLOCKED . \n This complicates the code , forcing several methods to deal with \n a special case of null NetworkCapabilities , no NetworkAgentInfo , \n etc . \n Fix this by isolating this outlandish behaviour to its own \n method . This allows the main codepaths not to have to support \n this unusual and not very useful edge case . \n Bug : 174123988 \n Test : pure refactoring , passes existing tests \n Change - Id : Ia52b24c59024c8f6e63e584b864e0225cb572090

Fix propagating underlying caps when a network disconnects . \n aosp / 1513052 , which generalized support for underlying networks , \n broke default network switching when the network underlying a VPN \n disconnects . \n This is because it calls propagateUnderlyingNetworkCapabilities \n in the middle of the bookkeeping operations needed when a \n network is disconnected ( specifically , after all satisified \n requests are removed from the disconnecting network , but before \n mDefaultNetworkNai is updated ) . This is completely incorrect \n because propagateUnderlyingNetworkCapabilities can trigger a \n network rematch , and running a rematch when the request data \n structures are inconsistent is obviously wrong . See the test \n changes in this CL for an example of the damage . \n Fix this by moving propagateUnderlyingNetworkCapabilities to \n before the bookeeping operations begin . It must be before \n mDefaultNetworkNai is updated , because otherwise it will not know \n that the default network is disconnecting , and it will not be \n able to propagate capabilities to VPNs that set underlying \n networks to null ( i . e . , to the default network ) . It must be \n after the nai is removed from mNetworkForNetId because \n otherwise it will think that the underlying network is still \n connected . \n Bug : 173331190 \n Test : accompanying unit test shows lots of bugs removed \n Change - Id : Ibf376a6fa4b34d1c96f8506fa8abbb7595a8c272

Don ' t keep track of field aliases in FieldTypeLookup ( # 64884 ) \n We currently keep track of field aliases which causes us to do two lookups for every field lookup . Instead , we could keep track of field aliases in the same map where ordinary fields are , by adding an entry that has the name of the field alias , and its corresponding field type is the field that that the alias points to .
Minor fix in dynamic template validation ( # 66166 ) \n As part of # 66156 the validation of dynamic templates has been adapted to support runtime fields . As part of that change , a ` break ` was forgotten , which causes needless additional validation rounds after a template has been already successfully validated against one of the field types .
MappingLookup to not implement Iterable ( # 64951 ) \n Implementing Iterable makes it hard to track who iterates through the mappers , and also it is not super clear what it allows to iterate through given that the object holds both field mappers and field types . \n This commit replaces implementing Iterable with a specific method called fieldMappers that returns an Iterable < Mapper >

Use LazyBlock for columns with no filters \n In cases when table scan is followed by projection with a conditional expression , it could \n be beneficial to delay loading some columns as they may never be needed . For example , if \n a = 2 is very selective ( less than 1 in a 1000 ) , using LazyBlock for b allows us to avoid \n reading b for pages with no hits . \n SELECT COUNT _ IF ( a = 2 AND cardinality ( b ) > 4 AND b [ 4 ] = 7 )

Fix pushdown for filters on multiple subfields of a struct
Fix spatial join on top of colocated right join \n Reference counting for the spatial index didn ' t take into account a possibility \n of having multiple SpatialJoinOperatorFactories . This caused the index to be \n deleted before all the probe operators were done processing . \n The fix is to increment reference count by 1 for each duplicate factory .
Support synthetic column names in Subfield \n Make $ - sign a valid character in subfield path to support filters on $ bucket \n and $ path columns , e . g . SELECT * FROM t WHERE $ bucket = 1 .
Change testBucketSortedTables to use ORC format \n ORC files can be read by both selective and batch readers , while RCBINARY \n can be read only by batch readers . Using ORC format allows to run the test \n for both kinds of readers . \n An alternative of expanding the test to cover all storage formats significantly \n increases test runtime ( from 10s to more than a minute ) .

Use HiveTestUtils . mapType in TestSubfieldExtractor and TestDomainTranslator
Reduce running time of presto - hive Travis job \n presto - hive Travis job regularly times out after 1 hour and 20 minutes . This \n change is to move some of the longer running tests into separate jobs . \n Specifically , move TestHivePushdownFilterQueries and \n TestParquetDistributedQueries into their own jobs .
Fix NPE in MapDirectSelectiveStreamReader \n MapDirectSelectiveStreamReader was throwing NPE when reading selected \n positions from all - nulls column .
Fix NPE in LongDirectSelectiveStreamReader \n LongDirectSelectiveStreamReader was throwing NPE when reading selected \n positions from all - nulls column .
Fix index out of bounds in LongDictionary . . . Reader
Disable PushdownSubfields rule \n Turns out PushdownSubfields doesn ' t interoperate with CBO yet . PushdownSubfields \n changes ColumnHandles , but TableScanStatsRule uses them to look up statistics in \n a map keyed by unmodified ColumnHandles . \n Introduced pushdown _ subfields _ enabled session property and \n experimental . pushdown - subfields - enabled configuration property with default value \n ' false ' to control whether PushdownSubfields rule runs or not .
Add test for range filter on a newly added column
Fix Values are too large error message \n Number of columns in the error message was always zero .
Add support for column names with hyphen to SubfieldTokenizer
Add SelectiveStreamReader . throwAnyError method \n Range filters on elements of lists and maps may result in " subscript out of bounds " \n errors , e . g . SELECT * FROM t WHERE a [ 10 ] > 0 query should fail if there is a row \n where a has fewer than 10 elements . Corresponding readers need a way to raise these \n errors , but only for positions that survived all other filters . Raising these errors \n from getBlock works only for readers that filter and project values out . Filter - only \n readers need a different mechanism and the new API provides that .
Add session property to disable adaptive filter reordering

Fix project import issue in Android Studio and a compilation failure
Upgrade Gradle wrapper for Android samples to Gradle 1 . 11 \n Android Studio 0 . 5 . 4 refuses to build with 1 . 10
use LinkedList to buffer the sequence’s items \n LinkedList has guaranteed constant insertion time when appending to the end of the list , whereas ArrayList takes O ( 1 ) amortized , since a reallocation might be necessary to insert further items . Since no capacity was specified for the buffer , on Hotspot this would cause the array to reallocate after the first 10 insertions , on Android after the first insertion ( since Android’s ArrayList uses a default capacity of zero . ) \n Since the buffer is copied to an ArrayList before emission , subscriber performance when working with the list should remain unaffected . \n Refs # 1141

[ scene2d ] Improved DragListener , allow getting drag start position and drag distance .
[ scene2d ] Label uses Integer . toString ( ) .
[ scene2d ] ScrollPane now updates the widget ' s culling area in layout ( ) , not just draw ( ) .
[ texturepacker ] Fixed crash when max size = = image size , padding > 0 , and edge padding = = false . \n BinarySearch should use actual min to max size , without padding . Padding is then applied to the value from Binary Search that is up for testing .

Javadoc warning . \n Newer Javas like to complain finalize is deprecated , even in the damn javadocs .
Fixed OrderedSet and OrderedMap arrays getting an object twice . \n When the stash is full , add / put was called and the OrderedXxx subclass added it to the array twice . Since we only try to put into the stash after checking there is no existing key , it should be safe to use addResize / putResize instead of add / put .
Allow Table # row to be called multiple times , returning the same row defaults .
Don ' t crash in keepWithStage when not in a stage .
Don ' t distribute negative " extra " space . \n Can happen when the layout size < min size .
Actor # setZIndex returns true if the z - index was changed .
Fixed setting PolygonRegion region . \n closes # 5039
[ scene2d ] Label # setText ( int ) returns true if the text was changed .
Validate immediately when the JFrame is resized .
[ scene2d ] Better ProgressBar exception message .
[ lwjgl3 ] idleFPS config value was not copied .
Use DelayedRemovalArray for InputMultiplexer . \n closes # 5298
Expose that the listeners arrays are DelayedRemovalArray .
Better Dialog show / hide javadocs . \n closes # 5301
Made TexturePacker print entire path of input image directory .
[ scene2d ] Only remove actor if its parent is the table .
[ scene2d ] ScrollPane , hide scrollbars if the scroll pane widget is not big enough for them to fit .
[ scene2d ] List , always track over item ( eg for drag and drop ) .
[ scene2d ] ClickListener , added setVisualPressed . \n Can be used to simulate a brief button press .
Fixed sprite and tiled drawables changing the sprite color . \n setPackedColor is probably never the right answer .
[ freetype ] Include shadow size in cap height . \n The AngleCode font format stores only " base " , which is capHeight + ascent . The capHeight is not stored , instead it is gotten from a glyph height . A bitmap font ' s glyph height includes shadow , so the FreeType font ' s capHeight must also . The achieved goal is identical rendering of a FreeType font and that same font turned into a bitmap font using BitmapFontWriter .
[ freetype ] Allow ` characters ` to have duplicates .
[ scene2d ] Don ' t rely on Gdx . input . isButtonPressed . \n The drag event may be processed after the button is released ( seeing this on Android ) . Not sure why this code was even here . It has been there since the dawn of time : 0beb056b9c442b7df3dcee088584b55435316e79
[ scene2d ] Added CheckBoxStyle # checkboxOnOver .
[ scene2d ] When a focus event is cancelled , fire another event to put it back . \n Consider 2 listeners , the first sees the focus changed and the second cancels . With this change , the first will see the focus change back . \n Cancelling the second event has no effect .
Fixed NinePatch copy constructor and tint ( ) using padding from the patch when it should use it from the drawable .
[ scene2d ] Added DragAndDrop # cancelTouchFocusExcept , DragAndDrop # getDragSource , and Source # drag .
[ scene2d ] Removed restriction from DragScrollListener that the scrolling only occurs when the mouse is directly above the scroll pane . \n It ' s enough that the mouse is above or below , as some scroll panes are used in such a way that they are more narrow than what they are scrolling .
[ scene2d ] TextField should not rely on focus events to determine focused state . \n Also reverts " [ scene2d ] When a focus event is cancelled , fire another event to put it back . " , commit 837456aa2d816d003a73a5b0293269f50e096666 . We don ' t fire a second event for any other event type when the change is cancelled , so it ' s odd to do it only for keyboard focus .
Fixed trimming the last glyph width when the glyph is fixed width . \n This prevents right aligned text that uses fixed width glyphs from jiggling .
Fixed generating fonts when the missing glyph is set . \n c942c61d5f8e8cf90e91ce3d1414d61cf9b4845e
Added to Pool javadocs . \n # 4310
Only generate a missing glyph if \ 0 is in the characters . \n # 5400 \n https : / / github . com / libgdx / libgdx / issues / 5400 # issuecomment - 429604857
[ scene2d ] Prevent drag and drop from hitting the drag actor . \n closes # 5403
Call the necessary array addAll method directly .
Fixed race condition when cancelling a task .
[ scene2d ] Fixed timing - based NPE with tooltips .
[ lwjgl2 ] Don ' t allow Java 9 + DPI scaling to affect canvas / frame size .
Anchor rendering in upper left corner when canvas is resized .
Remove by index methods for ordered map and set .
[ scene2d ] Fixed losing textfield focus .
[ scene2d ] Added Fixed # toString .
[ scene2d ] Allow progress bars / sliders to use negative padding .
[ scene2d ] Fixed vertical progress bar with no background . \n closes # 5454
Throw exception for invalid BitmapFont constructor parameters and if trying to create an empty font . \n closes # 5406
Fixed wrapped HorizontalGroup and VerticalGroup row alignment .
No need to check wrap here ( Horizontal / VerticalGroup ) .
[ scene2d ] Catch and rethrow runtime exceptions with actor information in notify ( ) and act ( ) .
Added Spine to the libgdx project generator .
Fixed Stage # setRoot not calling Actor # setStage . \n closes # 5476
[ scene2d . ui ] Made List # toString public . \n Sorry for the minor breakage , but it was unnecessarily restricted .
[ scene2d . ui ] Changed widgets to use Actor # hasKeyboardFocus .
Fixed AtlasRegion being created from a TextureRegion without considering the UVs . \n closes # 5484
[ texturepacker ] Changes necessary for more intelligent processing in subclasses .
[ scene2d ] Limit length of context added to notify / act stacktraces .
[ texturepacker ] Better log message for the input folder .
[ scene2d . ui ] Fixed tree pref width being incorrect ( too large ) .
[ scene2d . ui ] Tree should pack node actors in layout , not getPrefWidth / Height .
Disable blending after drawing stage debug . \n closes # 5490
Expose Kerning class . Removed unnecessary Integer wrapping .
[ lwjgl2 ] Fixed botched posted runnable stacktraces . \n oops . .
[ texturepacker ] Don ' t combineSubdirectories on subdirectories with a pack . json OR that have a parent directory with a pack . json . \n Eg : \n ` ` ` \n / pack . json ( combineSubdirectories = true ) \n / stuff1 . png \n / separate - page / pack . json ( combineSubdirectories = true ) \n / separate - page / stuff2 . png \n / separate - page / stuff / stuff3 . png \n ` ` ` \n This should result in stuff1 on one atlas page and stuff2 and stuff3 on another . Previously stuff1 and stuff3 were on a page and stuff2 was on another .
[ freetype ] Fixed blurry fonts ( blending was needed ) . \n Got a little carried away in 543dcca85e15dea7881561be2a565179f0cbfa17 .
Allow AsyncExecutor thread names to be specified .
Fixed ScrollPaneStyle constructor not copying " corner " . \n closes # 5564
Fixed pixmap blending on OS X . \n Doing the mask first then the right shift was no bueno on OS X .
[ scene2d ] TextField , ensure visible start / end are in range when display text changes .
[ texturepacker ] Allow empty pack . json . \n Useful to make a directory not get combined .
Fixed word wrap at break characters when the break character doesn ' t fit . \n Eg , using this text with BitmapFontTest : \n > Another font wrap is - sue , this time with multiple whitespace characters .
Ignore \ r in BitmapFont # getGlyphs . \n Otherwise GlyphLayout word wrap freaks out , but only sometimes , and I waste a bunch of time trying to debug !
[ scene2d . ui ] ScrollPane can use standard Actor # clipBegin / End . \n Enables shenanigans , eg override clipBegin and adjust clip bounds .
[ json ] Added support to Json for ObjectSet and IntSet . \n Not sure we want to try to support all of our data structures . Maybe would be better to provide serializer classes for each and require Json # setSerializer .
[ scene2d . ui ] Set batch color before drawScrollBars to allow subclasses to access parentAlpha .
[ texturepacker ] Allow setting the packer implementation .
[ scene2d . ui ] Fixed ScrollPane debug clipping .
Better error message when unable to create a pixmap .
Fixed ArraySelection # validate ( ) not calling changed ( ) .
Throw if vertex count is more than short max value . \n Indices are shorts .
Added ` degrees ` field for atlas regions .
Added TextField # drawMessageText . \n closes # 3091
[ scene2d . ui ] Better error when a tinted drawable is missing the color .
[ scene2d . ui ] Prevent text from rendering outside the textfield .
[ scene2d . ui ] Simplified when layout should happen multiple times . \n If the parent is not a WidgetGroup , we should not skip it and look at other ancestors .
[ texturepacker ] Removed bleed debugging code . \n Every time !
[ scene2d ] Fixed applyTransform ( ShapeRenderer , . . . ) not flushing the batch as the javadocs say .
Better illegal argument exceptions for table cells .
Added isAscendantOf and isDescendantOf for tree nodes .
Clear sets using clear ( int ) .
The toggle setting is now respected when ! required and selected . size = = 1 . \n This changes the default behavior for Tree , but for the better . Code outside libgdx should ` setToggle ( true ) ` to get old behavior .
Javadoc . \n # 5314 \n # 5631
Float . MIN _ VALUE is positive , use - Float . MAX _ VALUE . \n Thanks , Integer . MIN _ VALUE !
Fixed Array # removeRange not nulling elements .
Javadocs . \n Not reliable behavior for edges !
Added Travis badge . \n closes # 5582
Fixed compilation broken by merged PR # 5324 .
[ lwjgl2 ] Added LwjglFrame that takes a GraphicsConfiguration for choosing which monitor to show on .
Added getters for MoveToAction # startX / Y . \n closes # 5043
[ scene2d . ui ] ScrollPane # layout doesn ' t need to set a non - Layout actor ' s size .
[ scene2d ] Added dialog to stage , then pack . \n Gives the dialog a chance to use the stage in pack ( ) .
[ scene2d ] DragAndDrop , added isDragValid and getDragTime .
[ scene2d . ui ] Tree , fixed pref height . \n No idea why the pref height was using the current height , that should never be the case .
[ scene2d . ui ] Tree , fixed culling rectangle . \n Not sure how I committed the thing half done , but here we are .
[ scene2d . ui ] Container , when using fill it ' s safe to set the cullable rectangle on the child actor .
[ scene2d . ui ] List , renamed getDownItem - > getPressedItem . \n Sorry for the trouble , but this better matches Button # isPressed .
[ scene2d . ui ] Tree , update over node without needing to move the mouse .
[ scene2d . ui ] Tree , methods for drawing selection , over , icon .
[ scene2d . ui ] Tree , when changing a node ' s actor , only remove the old actor from the stage if it is in the tree . \n Otherwise it can be very confusing !
[ scene2d ] TextField , fixed range for visible start / end .
[ scene2d . ui ] Table # getRow now returns - 1 when over the table but not over a row ( used to return the last row ) .
Fixed incorrect sizing of BitmapFontCache # pageGlyphIndicies .
[ scene2d . ui ] Fixed Table # getRow returning a value larger than the number of rows .
[ collections ] Added Queue # toString ( String ) to match Array .
[ scene2d . ui ] Removed validate from ScrollPane getPrefWidth / Height . \n Related : d739e7ddd32c941875f0324414e94688ba39e0ff
[ scene2d ] Added padding to DragScrollListener .
[ texturepacker ] Better handling of root path .
[ texturepacker ] Strip whitespace before scaling .
Always apply interpolation for temporal actions . \n Allows interpolation that doesn ' t end at 1 . \n # 5515
Updated LWJGL2 backend from 2 . 9 . 2 to 2 . 9 . 3 . \n 2 . 9 . 3 has been out since 2015 !
[ json ] Fixed Json # copyFields using the wrong class for the to object .
[ scene2d ] Cancel TextField tasks if no longer in the stage . \n closes # 5746
Updated stb _ image defines . \n We use the failure strings and don ' t need file functions .
[ scene2d . ui ] Removed unnecessary code . \n # 5615
[ scene2d . ui ] Added missing field copy . \n # 5615
[ scene2d . ui ] Removed @ Override . \n It makes sense for application code . It isn ' t required for library code , where it just adds noise and the benefits for refactoring are insignificant . \n I removed it only from the classes I authored / maintain . Removing the thousands in other code would be nice , but I don ' t care as much and others like the clutter .
Ignore crash if shutting down while creating LwjglFrame .
Fixed right alignment in text fields . \n Previously the first character would affect the position of the right edge of the text .
[ texturepacker ] Better error message , progress .
[ scene2d . ui ] Tree , use icon spacing left when a node has no icon . \n Use it for the space between the plus / minus and the node actor .
[ scene2d . ui ] Slightly more interesting TreeTest .
[ scene2d ] If Group # addActorAfter is called with an afterActor not in the group , the actor is added as the last child ( not the first ) .
[ scene2d . ui ] Draw scroll pane debug border .
[ scene2d . ui ] Fixed scroll pane not showing scrollbars when fade scrollbars is disabled .
Fixed ColorAction when percent = = 0 . \n # 5515
[ scene2d ] Added Group # getChild ( int ) convenience method . \n It ' s pretty common to need to ` getChildren ( ) . get ( x ) ` .
Allow ScissorStack # peekScissors to be called when the stack is empty . \n Better than crashing .
Fixed timer tasks schedule during app pause . \n closes # 5810
Allow settings creation to be customized . \n Bit of a mess going on here , but changing it is a lot of effort !
[ texturepacker ] Revert " Strip whitespace before scaling . " Added getScale . \n This reverts commit f0b8d95aec647cd3141aca31882f0531b33bbe0c . Subclasses overriding stripWhitepsace can use getScale .
[ scene2d ] Set layout recursively even if the parent value is the same . \n Doesn ' t make sense to skip it , children may have been added / removed .
[ scene2d ] Convenience methods for BaseDrawable to set padding and min size .
DelaunayTriangulator , use the slightly more efficient array methods .
AssetManager , finishLoadingAsset now returns the loaded asset .
[ scene2d ] Cell # setLayout renamed to setTable . \n This was leftover from when the separate TableLayout project was forked for libgdx .
[ scene2d ] Only obtain an event for cancelTouchFocus if it is needed .
[ scene2d . ui ] Added ProgressBar # isAnimating ( ) .
Fixed OrderedMap using the wrong ( unsorted ) iterator .
ObjectSet # addAll now returns true if any items were added .
Added Color # valueOf that reads a string into an existing color object .
Changed OrderedSet # add ( T , int ) to not remove if the item is already at the right index . Javadocs .
Return ArrayIterable type so reset ( ) can be accessed .
Allow iterator toArray when there are no items for ordered map and set .
Added epsilon methods to ObjectFloatMap . \n # 6119
Javadocs on Color about float colors using compressed alpha . \n I assume no one ever reads NumberUtils javadocs .
JsonValue : adding a child was not setting prev . \n closes # 5849
Set default javac target to 1 . 6 . \n As it was before I borked it .
Fixed floatToRawIntBits not using NumberUtils for GWT .
Allow Actor # removeAction to accept null again . \n Disallowing null caused too many problems with existing code .
Removed unnecessary round . \n Floor ( int division ) seems better anyway .
TextField : Only revert the text if the change event was cancelled . \n Otherwise the text can ' t be manipulated in the change listener .
scene2d . ui SelectBox , invalidateHierarchy before firing the ChangeEvent . \n Can be surprising for some ChangeListeners to invalidate afterward .
Fixed Stage . stageToScreenCoordinates when using a viewport with screenY > 0 . \n closes # 5854
[ scene2d ] Minor clean up . Removed unnecessarily setting the style in TextButton .
Fixed Interpolation # pow2InInverse and # pow2OutInverse returning NaN when the value is zero .
Fixed GlyphLayout NPE with " \ n " and bounds with trailing " \ n " . \n closes # 6159
Fixed accidental change to Interpolation # pow3InInverse .
[ scene2d . ui ] A couple null checks that would otherwise be silent .
Allow for float error when checking if a glyph fits within the target width . \n closes # 6294
Added LwjglFrame # creating ( ) . \n This method is as close to possible to initializing OpenGL . \n I know this whole damn thing is quite a mess . Given LWJGL3 it ' s on its way out anyway , so what does it hurt to make the mess a teeny bit bigger .
GlyphLayout width considers the width of any glyph , not just the last . \n Individual runs still do not , but I ' m not sure that matters and this fix is less risky than the code paths for individual runs . \n closes # 6098
Fixed Array ' s PredicateIterable with Collections . allocateIterators .
[ scene2d . ui ] SelectBox clean up .
[ scene2d ] Don ' t need a temp color for SpriteDrawable .
GlyphLayout , moved pools and color stack to statics . \n The class was not thread safe before this commit , as it uses pools . Discussion long ago in # 3491 . At least now it is clear in the javadoc . \n The statics should be fine with Android resumes , as the Pools class is . \n Also changed in this commit is that the color pool isn ' t cleaned up until the next time it is used . This doesn ' t appear to be an issue and makes it a little nicer to do all the markupEnabled work in one place .
TextField , don ' t update the display text when the text didn ' t change .
GlyphLayout , fixed color markup not incrementing x .
Fixed TileDrawable not applying its scale correctly .
Fixed IntFloatMap having int value parameters . Added epsilon parameter to methods that look for a value . \n closes # 6119
Don ' t need a temp color for TiledDrawable .
Slightly better description of our alpha NaN fuckery .
[ scene2d . ui ] Made Skin # scale public .
Added QuadTreeFloat to gdx . gwt . xml .
[ scene2d . ui ] Added Container # clip ( ) .
Removed bogus optimizations added in 0b313004bd12d3aed7a0b744684fbccd57344115 . \n closes # 6128
[ scene2d . ui ] Don ' t move button children when there is no pressed offset .
Better slash replacement in AssetManager . \n # 6144
AssetManager invokes the loaded callback when an asset is unloaded from the load queue if the asset is already loaded . \n # 6144
[ scene2d . ui ] Cell javadocs for space < 0 and max size = = 0 .
[ scene2d . ui ] Added Progressbar updateVisualValue and round methods .
Fixed horizontal scrollpanes . \n closes # 6189
[ scene2d . ui ] Add Table # clip ( ) method to match Container .
[ scene2d . ui ] Fixed logic for button over + checked state .
Changed ternary operators to if statements to match similar widget methods . \n Eg in Button , ImageButton , etc .
[ scene2d . ui ] Buttons : if checked + over but no style . checkedOver , try style . over . \n Surprising how tricky things get !
[ scene2d . ui ] Added wrapReverse setting to HorizontalGroup .
[ scene2d . ui ] Set the subclass style field before calling super . setStyle . \n Widgets sometimes call methods to setup a reasonable initial state . When subclasses override those methods it gets messy . While there ' s no fix for that with significant changes , this helps a tiny bit in some cases .
[ lwjgl2 ] LwjglFrame , fixed the canvas not being hidden in some situations . \n For example , on Windows 10 on a monitor with no taskbar , when the frame ( undecorated in my case ) is the size of the window , when losing focus ( eg alt + tab ) before this fix the window remains on top of all other windows ( even though mouse input goes through to windows below ! ) .
[ lwjgl2 ] LwjglCanvas , improved redraw when resizing by checking the size after runnables and input . Also , set the canvas using the parent to fix some cases where the canvas is the wrong size .
[ scene2d . ui ] ProgressBar , fixed bg position when not rounding . \n Also added commented debug code in stage , useful occasionally during development .
NinePatch , fixed blurry rendering when using a single center region . \n new NinePatch ( TextureRegion ) places a single region in the center without surrounding regions . This is useful eg to specify a background that doesn ' t stretch but does have padding ( eg a slider background ) . Before this commit the 0 . 5 texel UV shift was always applied to the center , even if there are no surrounding regions , resulting in blurry rendering . Fixed by not applying the UV shift unless adjacent patches have a region .
[ scene2d . ui ] ProgressBar , fixed knob position going < bg left / bottom padding . Slider , added isOver . \n It should have been eg ` max ( 0 , bgLeftWidth ) ` rather than min , however the bg size is already > = 0 so we don ' t need it at all . \n We have isOver elsewhere , where it is already calculated ( eg Button ) , so it ' s convenient to expose it .
[ scene2d . ui ] ProgressBar , javadocs .
[ lwjgl2 ] LwjglFrame , need to redraw after the focus fix , else the buffer swap may show the previous frame . \n It ' s hax all the way down .
[ lwjgl2 ] LwjglFrame , improved focus lost fix . \n Seems Display . update ( false ) is not necessary now that we call requestRendering . Round and round we go !
Expose SpriteBatch and PolygonSpriteBatch setupMatrices ( ) as protected . \n Before this , the only way to get the matrices updated was to end / begin ( binds shader ) , setShader ( binds shader ) , or set the proj / trns matrix ( copies 16 floats ) . Between begin / end I would like to flush , modify the proj / trns matrices , and have the changes applied without binding the shader or copying the proj / trns matrix .
[ scene2d . ui ] Added font , background , and isOver protected methods to SelectBox . \n Similar to the methods in Button .
Allow LwjglFrame to customize the Gdx . input instance .
QuadTreeFloat , fixed nearest ( ) in some cases and use larger of the tree ' s width / height when the point is outside the tree .
TextureAtlas ( TextureAtlasData ) constructor does not accept null . \n Use TextureAtlas ( ) to create an empty atlas .
JsonReader , regenerated from Ragel , made . rl file match . java file .
Added TextureAtlas # load ( TextureAtlasData ) . \n Could load multiple TextureAtlasDatas into a single TextureAtlas .
[ scene2d . ui ] ScrollPane , fixed scrolling via mouse wheel when there are scrollbars in only one direction .
SpriteCache , fixed draw ( int , int , int ) . \n closes # 6334
Fixed Table debug lines . \n closes # 6363
TextureAtlasData , added zero arg constructor and load method .
Fixed StringBuilder # hashCode . \n closes # 6339
Prefer org . junit over junit . framework for OkHttp code .
Fix ResponseCacheTest for Android \n Pull # 1011 broke ResponseCacheTest on Android . \n The test was asserting a header generated \n using a copy of the old broken implementation . \n The test now just uses HttpDate , which now has its own \n tests .
Add a regression test for transparent gzip + basic auth \n The bug is fixed but there wasn ' t an obvious test . \n See report : https : / / code . google . com / p / android / issues / detail ? id = 74026
Change COMPATIBLE _ TLS to be TLSv1 . 0 and not SSLv3 \n Based on a discussion with Jesse Wilson during \n https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / pull / 1189 .
Avoid hardcoding the custom header prefix so the test uses the Platform value \n The test is failing under Android CTS tests . Android uses an " X - Android " \n prefix . \n This fix is benign and ensures the test passes in all cases .
Prevent MockSpdyPeer interfering with Android tests \n On Android we run the OkHttp tests as an instrumented test case . \n The default UncaughtExceptionHandler on Android will quit the \n app , causing the current test to fail . \n MockSpdyPeer creates a thread that fails for various reasons \n that are not related to / required for the actual test . Often the \n exception is thrown during a subsequent test . \n This change logs the exception but prevent it from \n propagating out of the top of the call stack . This decreases \n overall flakiness .
Apply fix for devices with large socket buffers \n The same fix as for ThreadInterruptTest from commit \n d95341bb7bc13ee2a4c7a08d6c7f9944a8a51ae3 , but made to \n DisconnectTest .
Modify the way MockWebServer selects a host IP to bind to \n On Android getByName ( null ) returns the first of \n [ IPv6 loopback , IPv4 loopback ] , binding the server to : : 1 . \n The IPv6 loopback address returns " localhost " . " localhost " \n does not resolve to the IPv6 address . \n Instead : explicitly select " localhost " ensuring \n MockWebServer binds to an IP that can be looked up by name \n and should also be a loopback address .
Fix the user agent test so it works with a different user agent string \n The important thing is that the Version . userAgent ( ) string is used and \n not the exact string .
TLSv1 supports TLS extensions so they should be enabled \n Follow up to : \n https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / pull / 1196 . \n Combined with an NPN bug ( 18705877 ) on Android this is the \n reason why fallback connections started failing on Android \n after the COMPATIBLE _ TLS was changed to be TLSv1 . \n [ The NPN bug means that once enabled on a socket from an \n SSLContext then NPN must be configured for every subsequent \n socket otherwise some of the NPN state will still be set , \n but some will be missing , leading to negotiation issues ] . \n The implication of this change is that the follow up request \n after a handshake failure may now be HTTP / 2 or SPDY \n ( or HTTP / 1 . 1 ) . Previous to this change they would always \n have been HTTP / 1 . 1 . \n Previous to pull 1196 they would also have been \n HTTP / 1 . 1 because COMPATIBLE _ TLS was SSLv3 .
Fix for MockWebServer on Android \n On Android L ( and probably prior releases ) it is necessary to \n close a socket explicitly rather than relying on \n InputStream / OutputStream to do it for you . \n See bug here : https : / / code . google . com / p / android / issues / detail ? id = 97564
Trivial optimization for comparing ConnectionSpecs \n ConnectionSpec instances will usually originate from \n final statics , particularly ConnectionSpec . CLEARTEXT . This seems \n like a no - brainer to avoid array comparisons .
Remove - SNAPSHOT from okio version \n This seems to be required for me to build successfully .
Fix MockWebServer with SPDY on Android . \n Fix for issue # 1552 \n Related to commit f78f74f from issue # 1294 \n Before this change : \n SpdyConnection creates threads to handle the reading and writing . If \n those threads die from a RuntimeException it triggers Android ' s default \n UncaughtExceptionHandler , which kills the test process . Previously exceptions \n were being swallowed , but commit f78f74f caused the exceptions to be \n propagated . \n This change adds extra handling for RuntimeException to stop them escaping .
Follow up fixes for # 1596 \n Small test and doc fixes .
Modify timeout exception / update test expectations \n Related to issue # 1676 . \n Depends on https : / / github . com / square / okio / pull / 154 \n URLConnection should throw SocketTimeoutException for timeouts \n not InterruptedIOException .
Partially revert connection timeout behavior \n Related to issue # 1790 . \n If there is a * connection * timeout the next route should \n be tried . Timeouts during a request / response should \n probably not be retried . \n The timeout / interrupt behavior was changed in PR # 1257 \n for issue # 1146 . This modified both connection and \n request / response behavior . The issue reported was actually \n about the use of Thread . interrupt ( ) , not timeouts , but the \n behavior change modified both behavior for interrupt and \n timeout . \n PR # 1388 split the handling of exceptions so that separate \n code now handles connection errors from that which handles \n request / response errors . It faithfully kept the behavior \n from PR # 1257 . \n The modification of the timeout behavior during * connection * \n caused problems on Android . Now that the two types of error \n handling are split it ' s possible to deal with them \n differently and return the connection behavior to trying \n the next route . This does not modify behavior during \n request / response .
Fix URLConnectionTest . writeTimeouts with large receive buffers \n The test relies on small client send / server receive buffers \n to force blocking and generate a timeout . \n The switch to make MockWebServer a @ Rule ( commit \n 785d9e94387f404f571775a49c3a9438508bb659 ) moved the \n MockWebServer . start ( ) call earlier in the test execution . \n Setting the ServerSocketFactory became a no - op so the server \n receive buffer size was left as the default . \n The test became reliant on either : \n 1 ) The default server socket receive buffer being small enough \n ( e . g . less than the data being transmitted ) . \n 2 ) The device being too slow to send the requested data in the \n time allowed . \n The test was recently made less reliable by : \n 1 ) The okio commit \n f30955cb15eb234f874dd55819686832c960765b , which made the segment \n size bigger ( increasing throughput / transfer efficiency ) . \n 2 ) The OkHttp commit f30955cb15eb234f874dd55819686832c960765b , \n which reduced the amount of data being sent in the test from \n 16MB to 2MB . \n 3 ) Recent Android devices have large default buffer sizes . e . g . \n Nexus 5 : 1MB , Nexus 5X : 6MB .
Source - incompatible : ResponseBody methods throw IOException \n This is a binary - compatible change , but code that currently calls \n ResponseBody [ contentLength ( ) | byteStream ( ) | source ( ) | charStream ( ) ] \n that doesn ' t necessarily catch or declare IOException will need \n to with this change . \n These methods could be performing I / O ( opening streams , etc . ) . \n Throwing IOException seems reasonable in this case . \n contentType ( ) and charset ( ) have not been changed .
Make the MockWebServer tests more Android compatible . \n There are a few cases in OkHttp where API calls don ' t exist on \n Android , but this is one that we can work around with any loss \n of understanding . \n The same test also behaves differently on Android due to \n differences between the OpenJDK and Android ' s \n HttpURLConnection implementation . \n See issue # 1824 .
Fix DelegatingSSLSocketFactory for Android \n Commit 765a965 ( pr # 1835 ) did not modify all the necessary lines \n when changing the configureSocket ( ) method over from a \n modify - in - place to a return - modified pattern . The problem \n only shows up on Android where the behavior is required for \n TLS _ FALLBACK _ SCSV tests to work .
Reduce the memory requirements of a test \n URLConnectionTest . testWrites allocates a 16MB buffer . \n It can run in less memory ( and causes problems \n on low - spec Android devices ) . \n 4k is the typical smallest allowable buffer size on Linux .
Fix Http ( s ) URLConnectionImpl . getInstanceFollowsRedirects ( ) \n Android bug : https : / / code . google . com / p / android / issues / detail ? id = 190998
Fix isClosed ( ) when a cache has not been initialized \n isClosed ( ) now means " has close ( ) been called " , after \n commit ea565b2e30e15cd52ddfc2ddc6db4ea8f1c3de88 \n it meant " has not been initialized or close ( ) has been \n called " . \n Introduced explicit closed state . Minor tweak to use \n initialized state to determine whether cleanup will \n do anything . Added a test .
Fix for SslContextBuilder / MockWebServer disagreeing about localhost \n MockWebServer binds to getByName ( " localhost " ) , SslContextBuilder was using \n InetAddress . getByName ( null ) ( null = = any loopback ) . On Android , null \n returns IPv6 loopback , which has the name " ip6 - localhost " .
Increase test timeout for slow devices \n OEMs have found some configurations of Android devices that cannot \n meet the timeout . This change doubles the timeout from 30 to 60 \n seconds . \n The Android bug reference is 27273056 .

Fix assertion in tryUpdateUserMemory method \n When DefaultQueryContext : : tryUpdateUserMemory ( ) is called with a delta \n of 0 and when the general pool is full , the updateUserMemory call will \n return a future that ' s not done . However , tryUpdateUserMemory was simply \n assuming that for that case the future must be done and asserting on \n that , which causes query failures . This change fixes that . \n It makes sense for updateUserMemory to return a future that ' s not done \n when we reserve 0 bytes and the pool is full , so that the caller knows \n that the pool is full and waits on that future to make the next \n reservation . Therefore , for the delta = = 0 case it ' s not correct to \n simply assume that future returned from updateUserMemory is done .
Fix TestColumnarPageProcessor \n When TestColumnarPageProcessor test methods run concurrently it ' s \n possible to see test failures due to the exception below as multiple \n threads will be sharing the PageProcessor instance ( hence the \n ExpressionProfiler instance ) . This change fixes that by creating a new \n PageProcessor for each test method . \n com . google . common . base . VerifyException : start ( ) is not called \n at com . google . common . base . Verify . verify ( Verify . java : 123 ) \n at com . facebook . presto . sql . gen . ExpressionProfiler . stop ( ExpressionProfiler . java : 59 )

Increase timeout in testCleanUpShardFollowTasksForDeletedIndices ( # 64562 ) \n If the deleted index has N shards , then ShardFollowTaskCleaner can send \n N * ( N - 1 ) / 2 requests to remove N shard - follow tasks . I think that ' s fine \n as the implementation is straightforward . The test failed when the \n deleted index has 8 shards . This commit increases the timeout in the \n test . \n Closes # 64311
Add TODO for IndexWriter # flushNextBuffer \n Relates # 34553
Ignore cancellation error when search is cancelled ( # 64240 ) \n Since # 63520 , we will cancel a search that hits shard failures and does \n not accept partial results . However , that change can return the wrong \n HTTP code for bad requests ( from 4xx to 5xx ) due to the cancellation . \n Relates # 63520 \n Closes # 64012 \n Closes # 63702
Busily assert in testCreateSearchContextFailure ( # 64243 ) \n If a background refresh is running , then the refCount assertion will \n fail as Engine # refreshIsNeeded can increase the refCount by 2 . \n Closes # 64052
Fix testCancelFailedSearchWhenPartialResultDisallowed ( # 64248 ) \n The search request in the test can complete before the " cancelledLatch " \n is latched if the second shard request is sent after the request was \n canceled ( i . e . , the child task is not allowed to start after the parent \n was canceled ) . \n Closes # 63976 \n Relates # # 63520
Stop renew retention leases when follow task fails ( # 65168 ) \n If a shard follow - task hits a non - retryable error and stops , then we \n should also stop the retention - leases renewal process associated with \n that follow - task .

Use test cluster exclusive in CancellableTasksIT ( # 67058 ) \n testRemoveBanParentsOnDisconnect disconnects some nodes and leaves the \n cluster in an unhealthy state , which fails other tests . We can reconnect \n nodes after that test . However , this commit chooses to run this suite \n test - cluster exclusive instead because it is simpler and more stable . \n Closes # 6652
Fix AllocationIdIT test failure on WindowFS ( # 67179 ) \n This test failed on WindowsFS . We failed to remove the corrupted file if \n it ' s being opened ( for a short window by ListShardStore action ) and the \n pending delete files were clear when we restarted that node . \n This commit fixes the issue by shutting down the node before removing \n the corrupted file to avoid any access to that file . \n Closes # 66893
Ensure IndexingPressure memory is re - adjusted once ( # 67673 ) \n We have seen a case where the memory of IndexingPressure was \n re - adjusted twice . With this commit , we will log that error with a \n stack trace so that we can figure out the source of the issue .
Ensure ReplicationOperation notify listener once ( # 68256 ) \n ReplicationOperation can notify the listener twice if the primary shard \n is demoted after it has completed the primary operation . \n Closes # 68049

Revert " Use SequentialStoredFieldsLeafReader to read Lucene changes ( # 67190 ) " ( # 68586 ) \n This reverts commit 5fe0d67ade5fed3de5b062a1a0837fd02286e0a9 . \n I benchmarked an improvement in CCR and found that changes introduced in \n # 67190 made CCR 10 times slower ( 1816 seconds to 26515 seconds ) . \n " total _ read _ remote _ exec _ time _ millis " : 26515182 \n " total _ read _ remote _ exec _ time _ millis " : 1816094 \n With concurrent indexing and Lucene merges , documents in segments are no \n longer sorted by sequence numbers . And if the index sorting is \n specified , documents are never sorted by sequence numbers .

Ignore errors loading font in CutoutTextView . \n We ' re using the sync method of loading the font , which apparently \n fails if the font is not available ( non - GMS device ? ) . We could \n try loading it async but Roboto Mono is used extensively elsewhere \n via downloadable fonts , so if it ' s not available here , then it ' s \n unlikely to ever be . Instead just ignore the error . \n Fixes # 390

Deprecate Unpooled . unmodifiableBuffer ( ByteBuf . . . ) ( # 8096 ) \n Motivation : \n Recent PR https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 8040 introduced \n Unpooled . wrappedUnmodifiableBuffer ( ByteBuf . . . ) which has the same \n behaviour but wraps the provided array directly . This is preferred for \n most uses ( including varargs - based use ) and if there are any unusual \n cases of an explicit array which is re - used before the ByteBuf is \n finished with , it can just be copied first . \n Modifications : \n Added @ Deprecated annotation and javadoc to \n Unpooled . unmodifiableBuffer ( ByteBuf . . . ) . \n Result : \n Unpooled . unmodifiableBuffer ( ByteBuf . . . ) will be deprecated .
Lazy initialize NativeDatagramPacketArray and IovArray in EpollEventLoop ( # 8160 ) \n Motivation : \n Avoid unnecessary native memory allocation if UDP / TCP isn ' t being \n used . \n Modifications : \n Create the reused NativeDatagramPacketArray and IovArray upon first use \n instead of EpollEventLoop construction . \n Also correct related comment in NativeDatagramPacketArray . \n Result : \n Reduced native memory use when using epoll in many cases
Fix incorrect sizing of temp byte arrays in ( Unsafe ) ByteBufUtil ( # 8484 ) \n Motivation : \n Two similar bugs were introduced by myself in separate recent PRs # 8393 \n and # 8464 , while optimizing the assignment / handling of temporary arrays \n in ByteBufUtil and UnsafeByteBufUtil . \n The temp arrays allocated for buffering data written to an OutputStream \n are incorrectly sized to the full length of the data to copy rather than \n being capped at WRITE _ CHUNK _ SIZE . \n Unfortunately one of these is in the 4 . 1 . 31 . Final release , I ' m really \n sorry and will be more careful in future . \n This kind of thing is tricky to cover in unit tests . \n Modifications : \n Revert the temp array allocations back to their original sizes . \n Avoid making duplicate calls to ByteBuf . capacity ( ) in a couple of places \n in ByteBufUtil ( unrelated thing I noticed , can remove it from this PR if \n desired ! ) \n Result : \n Temporary byte arrays will be reverted to their originally intended \n sizes .
Simplify ByteBufInputStream . readLine ( ) logic ( # 8380 ) \n Motivation : \n While looking at the nice optimization done in \n https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 8347 I couldn ' t help noticing the \n logic could be simplified further . Apologies if this is just my OCD and \n inappropriate ! \n Modifications : \n Reduce amount of code used for ByteBufInputStream . readLine ( ) \n Result : \n Slightly smaller and simpler code
AbstractChannelHandlerContext doesn ' t need to extend DefaultAttributeMap ( # 8960 ) \n Motivation : \n It appears this was an oversight , maybe was valid at some point in the past . Noticed while reviewing # 8958 . \n Modifications : \n Change AbstractChannelHandlerContext to not extend DefaultAttributeMap . \n Result : \n Simpler hierarchy , eliminate unused attributes field from each context instance .
Use interval instead of mask comparison for Recycler ratio ( # 9748 ) \n Motivation \n The recycling ratio is currently implemented by comparing with a masked \n count . The mask operation is not free and also not necessary . \n Modification \n Change the count ( s ) to just iterate over the corresponding interval , \n which requires only a comparison and no mask . \n Also make " first time recycle " behaviour consistent and revert change to \n RecyclerTest made in # 9727 . \n Result \n Less recycling overhead
Remove static wildcard imports in EpollDomainSocketChannelConfig ( # 9066 ) \n Motivation \n These aren ' t needed , only one field from each class is used . It also showed as an ambiguous identifier compilation error in my IDE even though javac is obviously fine with it . \n Modifications \n Static - import explicit ChannelOption fields in EpollDomainSocketChannelConfig instead of using . * wildcard . \n Result \n Cleaner / more consistent code .
Ensure channel handler close ( ) is not skipped in ! hasDisconnect case ( # 9098 ) \n Motivation \n The optimization in # 8988 didn ' t correctly handle the specific case \n where the channel hasDisconnect = = false , and a \n ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter subclass overrides only the close ( ctx , \n promise ) method without also overriding the disconnect ( ctx , promise ) \n method . \n Modifications \n Adjust AbstractChannelHandler . disconnect ( . . . ) method to divert to \n close ( . . . ) in ! hasDisconnect case before computing target context for \n the event . \n Result \n Fixes # 9092
Fix possible unsafe sharing of internal NIO buffer in CompositeByteBuf ( # 9169 ) \n Motivation \n A small thread - safety bug was introduced during the internal \n optimizations of ComponentByteBuf made a while back in # 8437 . When there \n is a single component which was added as a slice , \n internalNioBuffer ( int , int ) will currently return the unwrapped slice ' s \n un - duplicated internal NIO buffer . This is not safe since it could be \n modified concurrently with other usage of that parent buffer . \n Modifications \n Delegate internalNioBuffer to nioBuffer in this case , which returns a \n duplicate . This matches what ' s done in derived buffers in general \n ( for the same reason ) . Add unit test . \n Result \n Fixed possible thread - safety bug
OpenSsl . USE _ KEYMANAGER _ FACTORY incorrectly set to false with BoringSSL ( # 9175 ) \n Motivation \n SSL unit tests started failing for me ( RHEL 7 . 6 ) after # 9162 . It looks \n like the intention was to prevent disable use of the \n io . netty . handler . ssl . openssl . useKeyManagerFactory property when using \n BoringSSL , but it now gets set to false in that case rather than the \n prior / non - BoringSSL default of true . \n Modification \n Set useKeyManagerFactory to true rather than false in BoringSSL case \n during static init of OpenSSl class . \n Result \n Tests pass again .
Fix redundant or missing checks and other inconsistencies in ByteBuf impls ( # 9119 ) \n Motivation \n There are a few minor inconsistencies / redundant operations in the \n ByteBuf implementations which would be good to fix . \n Modifications \n - Unnecessary ByteBuffer . duplicate ( ) performed in \n CompositeByteBuf . nioBuffer ( int , int ) \n - Add missing checkIndex ( . . . ) check to \n ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf . nioBuffer ( int , int ) \n - Remove duplicate bounds check in \n ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf . getBytes ( int , byte [ ] , int , int ) \n - Omit redundant bounds check in \n UnpooledHeapByteBuf . getBytes ( int , ByteBuffer ) \n Result \n More consistency and slightly less overhead
Simplify SingleThreadEventExecutor . awaitTermination ( ) implementation ( # 9081 ) \n Motivation \n A Semaphore is currently dedicated to this purpose but a simple \n CountDownLatch will do . \n Modification \n Remove private threadLock Semaphore from SingleThreadEventExecutor and just use a CountDownLatch . \n Also eliminate use of PlatformDependent . throwException ( ) in startThread \n method , and combine some nested if clauses . \n Result \n Cleaner EventLoop termination notification .
Remove redundant epollWaitNow ( ) call in EpollEventLoop # closeAll ( ) ( # 9614 ) \n Motivation \n This is a vestige that was removed in the original PR # 9535 before it \n was reverted , but we missed it when re - applying in # 9586 . \n It means there is a possible race condition because a wakeup event could \n be missed while shutting down , but the consequences aren ' t serious since \n there ' s a 1 second safeguard timeout when waiting for it . \n Modification \n Remove call to epollWaitNow ( ) in EpollEventLoop # closeAll ( ) \n Result \n Cleanup redundant code , avoid shutdown delay race condition
Fix epoll spliceTo file descriptor with offset ( # 9369 ) \n Motivation \n The AbstractEpollStreamChannel : : spliceTo ( FileDescriptor , . . . ) methods \n take an offset parameter but this was effectively ignored due to what \n looks like a typo in the corresponding JNI function impl . Instead it \n would always use the file ' s own native offset . \n Modification \n - Fix typo in netty _ epoll _ native _ splice0 ( ) and offset accounting in \n AbstractEpollStreamChannel : : SpliceFdTask . \n - Modify unit test to include an invocation of the public spliceTo \n method using non - zero offset . \n Result \n spliceTo FD methods work as expected when an offset is provided .
Use alloc ( ) . heapBuffer ( . . . ) to allocate new heap buffer . \n Motivation \n Underlying array allocations in UnpooledHeapByteBuf are intended be done \n via the protected allocateArray ( int ) method , so that they can be tracked \n and / or overridden by subclasses , for example \n UnpooledByteBufAllocator $ InstrumentedUnpooledHeapByteBuf or # 8015 . But \n it looks like an explicit allocation was missed in the copy ( int , int ) \n method . \n Modification \n Just use alloc ( ) . heapBuffer ( . . . ) for the allocation \n Result \n No possibility of " missing " array allocations when ByteBuf # copy is used .
Fix NioEventLoopTest # testChannelsRegistered flakiness ( # 9650 ) \n Motivation \n NioEventLoopTest # testChannelsRegistered ( ) fails intermittently due to \n use of SingleThreadEventLoop # channelsRegistered ( ) which is not \n threadsafe and unreliable when called from outside the event loop . \n Modifications \n Add static registeredChannels method to NioEventLoopTest and \n AbstractSingleThreadEventLoopTest to call from the tests via event loop \n instead of directly . \n Result \n Hopefully fewer test failures
Null out completed tasks to help with garbage collection ( # 9613 ) \n Motivation \n When ScheduledFutureTasks complete , there ' s no need to retain a ref to \n the wrapped task . Clearing it could help in particular with the case \n where many scheduled tasks have been cancelled but their queue removal \n delayed ( since it is done lazily ) . \n Modifications \n This comprises just the PromiseTask changes from # 9580 . Upon completion , \n replace the task reference with a static sentinel depending on the type \n of completion ( so that it will be reflected by toString ) . \n Result \n More expedient collection of cancelled task objects
Fix ByteBufUtil # writeUtf8 subsequence split surrogate edge - case bug ( # 9437 ) \n Motivation : \n # 9224 introduced overrides of ByteBufUtil # writeUtf8 ( . . . ) and related \n methods to operate on a sub - CharSequence directly to save having to \n allocate substrings , but it missed an edge case where the subsequence \n does not extend to the end of the CharSequence and the last char in the \n sequence is a high surrogate . \n Due to the catch - IndexOutOfBoundsException optimization that avoids an \n additional bounds check , it would be possible to read past the specified \n end char index and successfully decode a surrogate pair which would \n otherwise result in a ' ? ' byte being written . \n Modifications : \n - Check for end - of - subsequence before reading next char after a high \n surrogate is encountered in the \n writeUtf8 ( AbstractByteBuf , int , CharSequence , int , int ) and \n utf8BytesNonAscii methods \n - Add unit test for this edge case \n Result : \n Bug is fixed . \n This removes the bounds - check - avoidance optimization but it does not \n appear to have a measurable impact on benchmark results , including when \n the char sequence contains many surrogate pairs ( which should be rare in \n any case ) .
Change javadoc of ByteBuf # indexOf ( . . . ) to match its behaviour ( # 9679 ) \n Motivation \n Currently doc ! = code and so one needs to change . Though behaviour as \n currently documented might be more intuitive , we don ' t want to break \n anyone so will adjust the doc instead . See # 9503 for discussion . \n Modifications \n Correct the javadoc of indexOf ( . . . ) method in ByteBuf abstract class . \n Results \n Correct javadoc
Avoid synthetic methods in Recycler ( # 9736 ) \n Motivation \n Currently the visibility of the various Recycler inner classes and their \n fields isn ' t optimal . Some private members are accessed by other classes \n resulting in synthetic methods , and other non - private classes / members \n are only accessed privately and so can be made private . \n Modifications \n - Increase / reduce visibility of various fields / methods / classes within \n Recycler \n - Have WeakOrderQueue extend WeakReference < Thread > to eliminate the \n owner field \n - Change local DefaultHandle var to DefaultHandle < ? > to avoid raw type \n compiler warning \n Result \n Tidier code , fewer implicit methods on hot paths ( reducing inlining \n depths )
Reduce ByteBuffer duplication when resizing pooled direct ByteBufs ( # 9765 ) \n Motivation : \n Currently when use of Unsafe is disabled and an internal reallocation is \n performed for a direct PooledByteBuf , a one - off temporary duplicate is \n made of the source and destination backing nio buffers so that the \n copy can be done in a threadsafe manner . \n The need for this can be reduced by sharing the temporary duplicate \n buffer that is already stored in the corresponding destination \n PooledByteBuf instance . \n Modifications : \n Have PoolArena # memoryCopy ( . . . ) take the destination PooledByteBuf \n instead of the underlying mem reference and offset , and use \n internalNioBuffer ( ) to obtain / initialize a reusable duplicate of the \n backing nio buffer . \n Result : \n Fewer temporary allocations when resizing direct pooled ByteBufs in the \n non - Unsafe case
Update to latest JMH version ( # 9787 ) \n Motivation \n JMH 1 . 22 was released recently , we might as well use the latest when \n running benchmarks . \n Summary of changes : \n https : / / mail . openjdk . java . net / pipermail / jmh - dev / 2019 - November / 002879 . html \n Modifications \n Update jmh dependencies in microbench module from version 1 . 21 to 1 . 22 . \n Result \n Benchmarks run using latest JMH
Small simplification to WriteTask optimization ( # 9807 ) \n Motiviation \n # 9800 was just merged which consolidates the flush / no - flush WriteTasks \n in AbstractChannelHandlerContext , but after looking at the changes again \n I noticed a tiny simplification that would be good to make imo . \n Modification \n Remove use of conditional operator in decrementPendingOutboundBytes ( ) \n Result \n Simpler code , one less branch
Fix incorrect behavior of ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf . getBytes ( int , ByteBuffer ) ( # 9125 ) \n * Fix incorrect behavior of ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf . getBytes ( int , ByteBuffer ) \n Motivation \n It currently will succeed when the destination is larger than the source \n range , but the ByteBuf javadoc states this should be a failure , as is \n the case with all the other implementations . \n Modifications \n - Fix logic to fail the bounds check in this case \n - Remove explicit null check which isn ' t done in any equivalent method \n - Add unit test \n Result \n More correct / consistent behaviour
Epoll : Don ' t wake event loop when splicing ( # 9354 ) \n Motivation \n I noticed this while looking at something else . \n AbstractEpollStreamChannel : : spliceQueue is an MPSC queue but only \n accessed from the event loop . So it could be just changed to e . g . an \n ArrayDeque . This PR instead reverts to using is as an MPSC queue to \n avoid dispatching a task to the EL , as appears was the original \n intention . \n Modification \n Change AbstractEpollStreamChannel : : spliceQueue to be volatile and lazily \n initialized via double - checked locking . Add tasks directly to the queue \n from the public methods rather than possibly waking the EL just to \n enqueue . \n An alternative is just to change PlatformDependent . newMpscQueue ( ) to new \n ArrayDeque ( ) and be done with it : ) \n Result \n Less disruptive channel / fd - splicing .
Lazily construct contained DataOutputStream in ByteBufOutputStream ( # 10507 ) \n Motivation \n This is used solely for the DataOutput # writeUTF8 ( ) method , which may \n often not be used . \n Modifications \n Lazily construct the contained DataOutputStream in ByteBufOutputStream . \n Result \n Saves an allocation in some common cases
1 is the second best number of threads , and is the default value if not specified on the OptionsBuilder
Modulo on sequence number was a bit funky , try an atomic long for safe inter - thread ( benchmark thread and event handler thread ) tracking of eventsHandled

The release fence should be before the store of value in sequence . \n We are intending a store / store barrier between this write and any previous store ( i . e . ringbuffer entry changes )
Add needed release fence before the store of volatile value in sequence . \n To get the same behaviour as volatile using memory barrier directly a full fence is not enough
Add missing @ Deprecated annotation to ` Disruptor . handleExceptionsWith `
Add Gradle compile options for tests and stop ignoring complaints of Unsafe use
Add warning suppression for lgtm alerts \n lgtm analysis has three alerts for these exceptions overriding ` fillInStackTrace ` and omitting the ` synchronized ` on the method . \n We are overriding to stop filling in the stack trace for performance reasons . \n These Exceptions are used for control flow more than reporting any error state , so this is a valid thing to do .
Added missing accessibility labels for all the buttons # 565

Ensure metadata is propagated . \n This change works around a peculiarity in the ExoPlayer media session \n extension and how metadata is propagated . \n By including a download status , MediaMetadataCompat will create an \n " extras " bundle , which will then be included when retreiving \n its MediaDescriptionCompat ( with ` . getDescription ( ) ` ) \n This in turn allows the placing of * all * of the metadata from \n the MediaMetadataCompat into the MediaDescriptionCompat that \n ` . getDescription ( ) ` returns , which is then passed along to the \n media session as one would expect . \n This should fix the issue of album art not appearing on the \n lockscreen : GitHub issue \n [ # 227 ] ( https : / / github . com / googlesamples / android - UniversalMusicPlayer / issues / 227 ) . \n Change - Id : I924dfd8caf0166e60b9d405e769d8cfa7f2351dc

Fix GitHub issue # 250 \n MusicService wasn ' t getting started , leading to a situation where the \n service would be killed and the ExoPlayer playback thread would continue \n to play queued songs until it was also killed or it completed the queue . \n This change ensures the service is started when playback begins so that \n the client may unbind without service being killed immediately . \n Change - Id : Ib4a846c2e60d3f0644b0b5843d1815dbd3caef68

Fix for # 231 \n This is a temporary fix for an issue where the metadata of the \n currently playing item isn ' t updated when the player is stopped . \n This change just makes sure that , if the player isn ' t " prepared " \n ( buffering , playing , or paused ) , it will send ` playFromMediaId ( ) ` \n rather than ` play ( ) ` when selecting an item . \n Change - Id : I35d1ea625c286f67eedad95062980b834443cf4e

Update skip after backport ( # 66024 ) \n After backporting # 65707 we can now run it in our backwards \n compatibility tests .
Fix eclipse compilation ( # 66047 ) \n Looks like we ' ve hit another " funny " eclipse compiler error . I filed \n https : / / bugs . eclipse . org / bugs / show _ bug . cgi ? id = 569557 , but short version \n is that the following code compiles with javac and not eclipse : \n ` ` ` \n package test ; \n import java . util . function . Supplier ; \n public class Test { \n private final Object o = new Object ( ) ; \n private class Inner { \n public Inner ( ) { \n this ( ( ) - > o ) ; \n } \n private Inner ( Supplier < Object > o ) { } \n } \n } \n ` ` ` \n Specifically the outer class ' s ` o ` can ' t be refered to in the lambda . \n This stops us from doing that in ML so eclipse can be happy again .
Drop experimental from variable width histogram ( # 66055 ) \n Its been several months and we haven ' t bumped into any good reason to \n rework the variable width histogram . So let ' s drop experimental from it ! \n Closes # 58573
Give test a little more space \n In # 64744 I added a randomized test for how much room a part of the \n cardinality use in memory . It ' s bound were a little low . This gives it a \n few more bytes before it falls over so we don ' t see the test fail 1 % or \n 2 % of the time .
Fix buggy test \n In # 64374 I broke a test that serializes ` SearchRequest ` with a random \n version . I ' m unsure how we didn ' t catch this in the PR tests but \n computers are tricky . This fixes the test by removing runtime mappings \n for versions that don ' t support it .
hush bwc tests \n Backport is coming . Please wait .
Update skip after backport ( # 64369 ) \n Now that # 64214 has landed in 7 . 10 we can run the bwc test including it .
Drop old assertion in test \n Drops an assertion that in 1911 Paris rolled its clocks back past \n midnight . This assertion is so far in the past that it isn ' t \n consistently included in the JDK ' s tzdb . When we upgraded to 15 . 0 . 1 it \n fell out of my tzdb locally . It doesn ' t seem to have happened to CI , \n oddly , but it just doesn ' t seem worth keeping .
Reenable bwc tests after backport ( # 64935 ) \n Now that # 64374 has been backported to 7 . x we can run the bwc tests \n again without wire incompatibilities .
Fix range tests \n Some of the ` range ` agg tests thought that millis were nanos . Oops . \n Closes # 57651
Better mimick real reduction in test \n This changes has ` InternalAggregationTestCase ` performs partial \n reductions to better mimick ` InternalAggregations # reduce ` . In \n particular , this fixes a bug when we ' d attempt a partial reduction of \n aggregations that were entirely unmapped but use a mapped aggregation as \n the " lead " of the reduction . This was possible in the test but isn ' t \n possible in production . The reduction " lead " is unmapped if all agg \n results being reduced are unmapped . \n Closes # 65118
Fix a rare failure in FiltersAggregatorTests \n It reproducibly fails about . 3 % of the time because we configure a field \n to have doc values but don ' t provide them . This configures the field not \n to have doc values .
Update skip after backport of # 66295 ( # 66808 ) \n Now that # 66295 has landed in 7 . 11 we can run the bwc tests it adds \n against that branch .
Fix optimization in runtime fields tests \n The runtime fields tests tried to skip iterating a ` Map ` ' s keys if we \n only have a single pattern but it was checking that we had ` 0 ` patterns \n instead . Ooops !
Drop rawtypes warning from async search ( # 68248 ) \n It looks like we don ' t need it and it helps us write code with " funny " \n assumptions without realizing it .
Drop rawtypes error suppression in runtime - fields ( # 68245 ) \n We don ' t need it and it stops the compiler from warning us if we make \n code that is harder to read .
Drop unused checkstyle suppressions \n These suppressions no longer do anything because the files they point to \n have resolved their line length issues .
Remove rawtype suppression in analytics ( # 68242 ) \n This removes some of the compiler warnings in the analytics subproject \n and zaps the compiler config required to compile with the warning .
Update skip after backport ( # 69710 ) \n Now that we ' ve backported # 69377 to 7 . x we can run backwards \n compatibility tests against it .
Help eclipse compilation ( # 67403 ) \n Eclipse wasn ' t seeing the special shadow jars we were making for \n repository - azure and repository - hdfs so it wasn ' t able to compile those \n plugins . This points Eclipse at the project that we use to build the \n shadow jar which gets it compiling . The tests don ' t pass because we \n aren ' t pointing at the shadow jars but at least we compile .
Fix painless tests in eclipse ( # 67602 ) \n ` Augmentation . java ` had a zero width space [ 1 ] in two method \n definitions : \n ` ` ` \n public static String [ ] split ( Pattern receiver , int limitFactor , CharSequence input , int limit ) { \n ^ - - - - - - - Right before the ( character \n public static Stream < String > splitAsStream ( Pattern receiver , int limitFactor , CharSequence input ) { \n ^ Right before the ( here too \n ` ` ` \n Sadly , Eclipse and javac treat this character differently . Eclipse seems \n to include it in the method name and javac seems to treat it as regular \n space . This caused all the unit tests for painless to fail to load \n because they couldn ' t find the ` split ` and ` splitAsStream ` \n augmentations . But if you listed all of the methods they looked like \n they were there . If you crack open the line in a hex editor you can see \n it . \n Eclipse is tracking [ 2 ] similar issues . \n [ 1 ] : https : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Zero - width _ space \n [ 2 ] : https : / / bugs . eclipse . org / bugs / show _ bug . cgi ? id = 547601
Fix painless build in eclipse ( # 68166 ) \n Painless now has a ` doc ` source which has its own dependencies . That ' s \n lovely for everything but Eclipse doesn ' t understand that sort of thing . \n This adds the docs dependencies to the regular build path when building \n with Eclipse .
Docs : Add example fetching keyword in top _ metrics ( # 69135 ) \n Adds an example of fetching a keyword field .
Update skip after backport of # 68930 ( # 69233 )
Fix test bounds \n Fix a test mistake that I just committed in # 68592 . I a bad set of \n bounds on the randomized values used by the " short " set of tests . Mostly \n because I fogot that ` ^ ` isn ' t the exponentiation operator . . . . .
Fixup aggs test ( # 69476 ) \n One of the tests that I added in # 68871 worked about 99 . 7 % of the time \n but on some seeds failed to generate the right buckets because on those \n seeds we would collect each segment with its own aggregator and get bad \n counts . This " bad counts " problem is known in the terms aggregator - its \n the price we pay for distributed work . But we can work around it either \n by forcing all the docs into a single segment or by collecting all of \n the buckets on the shard . We want to test the code path where don ' t \n collect all buckets on the shard so we opt for the former . \n Closes # 69413
Test : Fix filter assertion \n Forces a test to use only a single shard so the assertion about the \n aggregation profiler results are correct . Without this the test fails \n randomly but very rarely . We have to use multiple shards ( seeded random \n 10 % choice ) and we have to land all of the documents on one shard \n ( unseeded random 3 . 2 % ) and that shard has to be the second shard in the \n list ( unseeded random 50 % ) . That works out to about 1 . 6 % chance with an \n appropriate seed - . 16 % without it .
Test : Clean up a stray NPE ( # 69566 ) \n When we test the REST actions we assumed that they ' d produce a result \n but one of the mocking / verification mechanisms didn ' t . This forces it to \n produce a result . It uses some generics dancing to force the calling \n code to mock things with the appropriate type even though we don ' t its \n only a compile time guarantee . So long as callers aren ' t rude its safe .
Skip test before backport \n Skip running the a particular filters aggregator test while we backport \n the change that ' ll make it correct .
Drop rawtypes warnings from identityprovider ( # 68249 ) \n We barely used it and it makes it easier for us to write code with \n " funny " assumptions . This change mostly makes the assumptions more clear \n without really changing them . \n Co - authored - by : Elastic Machine < elasticmachine @ users . noreply . github . com >
Slightly speed up scripts ( # 68478 ) \n This saves a couple of nanoseconds on ever invocation of a painless \n script that uses ` SearchLookup ` . Which is most of the scripts in the hot \n path . This amounts to a 3 . 5 % performance savings for things like script \n scoring and runtime fields . We got this by speeding up a method that the \n async profiler reported as taking 20 % of the time running a script score \n with painless . This drops it to 1 % . You ' d think that ' d result in a 19 % \n speed up . But no such luck .
Painless : improve bad regex pattern syntax error ( # 68520 ) \n Adds extra information about the actual error in the pattern to the \n error painless returns when you specify a bad pattern . This information \n was hiding in the exception that ` Pattern . compile ` throws but isn ' t \n included in its message so we were never showing it to anyone . These \n error message include such gems as : \n * named capturing group < name > does not exist \n * Look - behind group does not have an obvious maximum length \n * Unclosed counted closure \n Now you ' ll get to know what you need to change about your pattern and \n not just where it went wrong !
Painless : improve error message on non - constant ( # 68517 ) \n As of # 68088 painless can have methods where all parameters must be \n constant . This improves the error message when the parameter isn ' t . It ' s \n still not super great , but its better and its what we can easilly give \n at that point in the compiler .
Runtime fields : update comments on script context ( # 68526 ) \n We had some super informative comments on the script context \n configuration that we share for all of runtime fields . But they were out \n of date . They assumed that runtime fields can only show up in the \n mapping .
Fix preallocted breaker test failure ( # 67022 ) \n The randomized test for pre - allocated breakers would sometimes attempt \n to consume the entire request breaker and fail . This limits it to 100mb \n and aborts the test if that doesn ' t fit comfortable into the breaker . \n The 100mb limit also fixes another sneaky issue - the randomized values \n for the test used to depend on the size of the request breaker which \n itself depends on the size of the heap . We run the tests with 512m heap \n in gradle but IDEs are kind of the wild west . That made it very \n difficult to reproduce the issue . \n There is still some heap dependent randomization here , sadly . We use \n non - heap dependent randomization to bump the breaker but whether or not \n the breaker trips is dependent on heap size . This is , sadly , kind of \n inevitable because we want to test against a real breaker so we can make \n sure we handle circuit breaking sensibly .
Minor deserialization bug fix in TableFinishInfo \n The bug is introduced in 7f3633ab10ef3a8bb14b1b4a7d579ac6b407a90b

Remove unnecessary instantiation of HttpResponseStatus \n Motivation : \n - In the ` HttpResponseStatus # equals ` checks only status code . No need to create new instance of ` HttpResponseStatus ` for comparison with response status . \n - The RFC says : ` the HTTP version and reason phrase aren ' t important ` [ 1 ] . \n Modifications : \n Use comparison by status code without creating new ` HttpResponseStatus ` . \n Result : \n Less allocations , more clear code . \n [ 1 ] https : / / tools . ietf . org / html / draft - ietf - hybi - thewebsocketprotocol - 00
AbstractMethodError with barchart - udt \n Motivation : \n ` SocketChannelUDT ` from barchart - udt does not have the java 7 ` public abstract SocketChannel bind ( SocketAddress local ) ` method . Calling the abstract method ` SocketChannel . bind ( SocketAddress localAddress ) ` for ` SocketChannelUDT ` leads to an ` AbstractMethodError ` runtime error . \n Modifications : \n Make workaround with explicit call of ` SocketChannelUDT . bind ( SocketAddress local ) ` as it done in ` NioUdtByteConnectorChannel ` . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 6934 ] .
Clarify the appointment of the intermediate collection \n Motivation : \n An intermediate list is creating in the ` EpollEventLoop # closeAll ` to prevent ConcurrentModificationException . But this is not the obvious purpose has no comment . \n Modifications : \n Add comment to clarify the appointment of the intermediate collection . \n Result : \n More clear code .
Avoid a double check ByteBuf # ensureWritable in ByteBufUtil \n Motivation : \n Methods ` ByteBufUtil # writeUtf8 ` and ` ByteBufUtil # writeAscii ` contains a check ` ByteBuf # ensureWritable ` before the calling ` ByteBuf # writeBytes ` . But the ` ByteBuf # writeBytes ` also do a such check inside . \n Modifications : \n Make checks more targeted . \n Result : \n Less redundant method calls .
Remove double comparing of content out of the DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame . equals ( ) \n Motivation : \n In ` DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame . equals ( ) ` a content compared twice : explicitly and in the ` super ` method . \n Modifications : \n Remove explicit content comparision . \n Make ` hashCode ( ) ` consistent with ` equals ( ) ` . \n Result : \n A ` DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame . equals ( ) ` work faster .
Optimize DefaultChannelId . equals \n Motivation : \n A ` DefaultChannelId ` has final ` hashCode ` field calculated in the constructor . We can use it in ` equals ` to the fast return for different objects . \n Modifications : \n Use ` hashCode ` field in ` DefaultChannelId . equals ( ) ` . \n Result : \n Fast ` equals ` on negative scenarios .
Fix hashCode ( ) in Http2StreamChannelId \n Motivation : \n In ` Http2StreamChannelId ` a ` hashCode ( ) ` is not consistent with ` equals ( ) ` . \n Modifications : \n Make a ` Http2StreamChannelId . hashCode ( ) ` consistent with ` equals ( ) ` . \n Result : \n Faster hash map ' s operations where the Http2StreamChannelId as keys .
Make configurable the initial and max size of InternalThreadLocalMap # stringBuilder \n Motivation : \n In some cases of using an ` InternalThreadLocalMap # stringBuilder ` , the ` StringBuilder ` s size can often exceed the exist limit ( 1024 bytes ) . This can lead to permanent memory reallocation . \n Modifications : \n Add custom properties for the initial capacity and maximum size ( after which the ` StringBuilder ` s capacity will be reduced to the initial capacity ) . \n Result : \n An ` InternalThreadLocalMap # stringBuilder ` s initial and max size is configurable . Fixes [ # 7092 ] .
Minor improvements in ByteBufOutputStream \n Motivation : \n In the ` ByteBufOutputStream ` we can use an appropriate methods of ` ByteBuf ` \n to reduce calls of virtual methods and do not copying converting logic . \n Modifications : \n - Use an appropriate methods of ` ByteBuf ` \n - Remove redundant conversions ( int - > byte , int - > char ) . \n - Use ` ByteBuf # writeCharSequence ` in the ` writeBytes ( String ) ' . \n Result : \n Less code duplication . A ` writeBytes ( String ) ` method is faster . \n No unnecessary conversions . More consistent and cleaner code .
Fixes a javadoc for ByteBufUtil # copy method \n Motivation : \n Javadoc of the ` ByteBufUtil # copy ( AsciiString , int , ByteBuf , int , int ) ` is incorrect . \n Modifications : \n Fix it . \n Result : \n The description of the ` # copy ` method is not misleading .
Fixes a LoggingHandler # format method with two arguments \n Motivation : \n Bug in capacity calculation : occurs auto convert to string instead of sum up . \n Modifications : \n Use ` eventName . length ( ) ` in sum . \n Result : \n Less trash in logs .
The constants calculation in compile - time \n Motivation : \n Allow pre - computing calculation of the constants for compiler where it could be . \n Similar fix in OpenJDK : [ 1 ] . \n Modifications : \n - Use parentheses . \n - Simplify static initialization of ` BYTE2HEX _ * ` arrays in ` StringUtil ` . \n Result : \n Less bytecode , possible faster calculations at runtime . \n [ 1 ] https : / / bugs . openjdk . java . net / browse / JDK - 4477961
Don ' t check accessible in the # capacity method ( # 7830 ) \n Motivation : \n The ` # ensureAccessible ` method in ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf # capacity ` used \n to prevent NPE if buffer is released and ` array ` is ` null ` . In all \n other implementations of ` ByteBuf ` the accessible is not checked by \n ` capacity ` method . We can assign an empty array to ` array ` \n in the ` deallocate ` and don ' t worry about NPE in the ` # capacity ` . \n This will help reduce the number of repeated calls of the \n ` # ensureAccessible ` in many operations with ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf ` . \n Modifications : \n 1 . Remove ` # ensureAccessible ` call from ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf # capacity ` . \n Use the ` EmptyArrays # EMPTY _ BYTES ` instead of ` null ` in ` # deallocate ` . \n 2 . Fix access checks in ` AbstractUnsafeSwappedByteBuf ` and \n ` AbstractByteBuf # slice ` that relied on ` # ensureAccessible ` \n in ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf # capacity ` . This was found by unit tests . \n Result : \n Less double calls of ` # ensureAccessible ` for ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf ` .
Makes ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` and ` AbstractByteBuf # hashCode ` consistent ( # 7870 ) \n Motivation : \n The ` AbstractByteBuf # equals ` method doesn ' t take into account the \n class of buffer instance . So the two buffers with different classes \n must have the same ` hashCode ` values if ` equals ` method returns ` true ` . \n But ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` is not consistent with ` # hashCode ` \n of the empty ` AbstractByteBuf ` , that is violates the contract and \n can lead to errors . \n Modifications : \n Return ` 1 ` in ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` . \n Result : \n Consistent behavior of ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` and ` AbstractByteBuf # hashCode ` .
Minor : use unique temp directories in jps - build tests
Remove usage of idea file systems for checking js libraries \n The removed code is probably an outdated code from the age when Kotlin \n compiler was using VirtualFiles for operating . Previously the links were \n stored and passed further , but now it is only some additional check \n ( files are unused after the check ) with an implicit dependency to \n IDEA internals . \n The deleted check could probably be responsible for handling references \n to JS libraries because of the working compiler daemon . \n The code was spotted during an investigation for the \n 2bf22caeb7c687cd6b54b05b11e5c0f1a3caa07c commit ( there ' s a detailed \n description in the commit message ) .

Http2MultiplexCodec . DefaultHttpStreamChannel . isOpen ( ) / isActive ( ) shoule be false when fireChannelActive ( ) is called \n Motivation : \n When part of a HTTP / 2 StreamChannel the Http2StreamChannel . isOpen ( ) / isActive ( ) should report false within a call to a ChannelInboundHandlers channelInactive ( ) method . \n Modifications : \n Fullfill promise before call fireChannelInactive ( ) \n Result : \n Correctly update state / promise before notify handlers . Fixes [ # 7638 ]
Reduce objects by directly implement interface in internal implementations of DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController \n Motivation : \n We can just implement the interfaces directly and so reduce object creation in DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController . \n Modifications : \n Directly implement the interfaces . \n Result : \n Less object creation .
CorsHandler . write ( . . . ) should not cause a flush . ( # 7839 ) \n Motivation : \n Unnecessary flushes reduce the amount of flush coalescing that can happen at higher levels and thus can increase number of packets ( because of TCP _ NODELAY ) and lower throughput ( due to syscalls , TLS frames , etc ) \n Modifications : \n Replace writeAndFlush ( . . . ) with write ( . . . ) \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7837 .
Remove direct usage of JKS and SunX509 \n Motivation : \n When using netty on android or with for example a IBM JVM it may not be able to build a SslContext as we hardcoded the use of JKS and SunX509 ( which both may not be present ) . \n Modifications : \n - Use the default algorithm / type which can be override via a System property \n - Remove System property check as its redundant with KeyManagerFactory . getDefaultAlgorithm ( ) \n Result : \n More portable code . Fixes [ # 7546 ] .
Allow to write Http2UnkownFrame when using Http2FrameCodec / Http2MultiplexCodec ( # 7867 ) \n Motivation : \n We should allow to write Http2UnkownFrame to allow custom extensions . \n Modifications : \n Allow to write Http2UnkownFrame \n Add unit test \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7860 .
Make UnpooledDirectByteBuf , UnpooledHeapByteBuf and UnpooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf constructors public . \n Motivation : \n The constrcutors a protected atm but the classes are public . We should make the constructors public as well to make it easier to write your own ByteBufAllocator . \n Modifications : \n Change constructors to be public and add some javadocs . \n Result : \n Easier to create own ByteBufAllocator .
Fix reference count issue when using Http2FrameCodec / Http2MultiplexCodec with HttpServerUpgradeHandler \n Motivation : \n When using Http2FrameCodec / Http2MultiplexCodec with HttpServerUpgradeHandler reference count exception will be triggered . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly retain before calling InboundHttpToHttp2Adapter . handle \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7172 ] .
Fix possible NPE in ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine . rejectRemoteInitiatedRenegotiation ( ) \n Motivation : \n ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine . rejectRemoteInitiatedRenegotiation ( ) is called in a finally block to ensure we always check for renegotiation . The problem here is that sometimes we will already shutdown the engine before we call the method which will lead to an NPE in this case as the ssl pointer was already destroyed . \n Modifications : \n Check that the engine is not destroyed yet before calling SSL . getHandshakeCount ( . . . ) \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7353 ] .
Correctly handle WebSockets 00 when using HttpClientCodec . \n Motivation : \n 7995afee8f1cb9047709239321d84ccb279fe4d1 introduced a change that broke special handling of WebSockets 00 . \n Modifications : \n Correctly delegate to super method which has special handling for WebSockets 00 . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7362 ] .

Fix incorrect javadocs in Http2RemoteFlowController \n Motivation : \n The javadocs of Http2RemoteFlowController . isWritable ( . . . ) are incorrect . \n Modifications : \n Update javadocs to reflect reality . \n Result : \n Correct javadocs .
asm 6 . 0 _ BETA was released so we should use it when building on java9 \n Motivation : \n We used asm 6 . 0 _ ALPHA when building on java9 as the latest stable release not works with java9 . asm 6 . 0 _ BETA was just released so we should update . \n Modifications : \n Upgrade asm version \n Result : \n Not use ALPHA release anymore
Ensure the tests complete on java7 and java9 as well . \n Motivation : \n 379ac890f4dbec15d19714711f85455a12112c3f introduced the usage of the inline mock maker . This unfortunally not work on java7 and java9 . \n Modifications : \n Just use reflection to create the event for now . \n Result : \n Netty tests pass again on java7 and java9 as well .
Remove not needed intermediate collection while reading DatagramPackets in native transports \n Motivation : \n We used an intermediate collection to store the read DatagramPackets and only fired these through the pipeline once wewere done with the reading loop . This is not needed and can also increase memory usage . \n Modifications : \n Remove intermediate collection \n Result : \n Less overhead and possible less memory usage during read loop .
Also use realloc when shrink the buffer . \n Motivation : \n We should also use realloc when shrink the buffer to eliminate extra allocations / memory copies when possible . \n Modifications : \n Use realloc for expanding and shrinking when possible . \n Result : \n Less memory copies and allocations
Not add inboundStreamHandler for outbound streams created by Http2MultiplexCodec . \n Motivation : \n We must not add the inboundStreamHandler for outbound streams creates by Http2MultiplexCodec as the user will specify a handler via Http2StreamChannelBootstrap . \n Modifications : \n - Check if the stream is for outbound and if so not add the inboundStreamHandler to the pipeline \n - Update tests so this is covered . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7178 ]
Ensure we not try to call ` select ` when the ` AbstractSniHandler ` was already removed from the pipeline . \n Motivation : \n We tried to call ` select ` after we closed the channel ( and so removed all the handlers from the pipeline ) when we detected a non SSL record . This would cause an exception like this : \n ` ` ` \n Caused by : java . util . NoSuchElementException : io . netty . handler . ssl . SniHandler \n at io . netty . channel . DefaultChannelPipeline . getContextOrDie ( DefaultChannelPipeline . java : 1098 ) \n at io . netty . channel . DefaultChannelPipeline . replace ( DefaultChannelPipeline . java : 506 ) \n at io . netty . handler . ssl . SniHandler . replaceHandler ( SniHandler . java : 133 ) \n at io . netty . handler . ssl . SniHandler . onLookupComplete ( SniHandler . java : 113 ) \n at io . netty . handler . ssl . AbstractSniHandler . select ( AbstractSniHandler . java : 225 ) \n at io . netty . handler . ssl . AbstractSniHandler . decode ( AbstractSniHandler . java : 218 ) \n at io . netty . handler . codec . ByteToMessageDecoder . decodeRemovalReentryProtection ( ByteToMessageDecoder . java : 489 ) \n at io . netty . handler . codec . ByteToMessageDecoder . callDecode ( ByteToMessageDecoder . java : 428 ) \n . . . 40 more \n ` ` ` \n Modifications : \n - Ensure we rethrow the NotSslRecordException when detecting it ( and closing the channel ) . This will also ensure we not call ` select ( . . . ) ` \n - Not catch ` Throwable ` but only ` Exception ` \n - Add test case . \n Result : \n Correctly handle the case of an non SSL record .
Only try to match SSLException message when debug logging is enabled . \n Motivation : \n We only want to log for the particular case when debug logging is enabled so we not need to try to match the message if this is not the case . \n Modifications : \n Guard with logger . isDebugEnabled ( ) \n Result : \n Less overhead when debug logging is not enabled .
Add testcases to prove HttpResponseEncoder correctly handles empty content \n Motivation : \n Issue # 6695 states that there is an issue when writing empty content via HttpResponseEncoder . \n Modifications : \n Add two test - cases . \n Result : \n Verified that all works as expected .
Not log notify failure for DelegatingChannelPromiseNotifier when promise is VoidChannelPromise \n Motivation : \n We should not log by default if the promise is a VoidChannelPromise as its try * methods will always return false . \n Modifications : \n Do an instanceof check to determine if we should log or not by default \n Result : \n No more noise in the logs when using a VoidChannelPromise .
Fail the connectPromise with the correct exception if the connection is refused when using the native kqueue transport . \n Motivation : \n Due a bug we happen to sometimes fail the connectPromise with a ClosedChannelException when using the kqueue transport and the remote peer refuses the connection . We need to ensure we fail it with the correct exception . \n Modifications : \n Call finishConnect ( ) before calling close ( ) to ensure we preserve the correct exception . \n Result : \n KQueueSocketConnectionAttemptTest . testConnectionRefused will pass always on macOS .
Revert " Set readPending to false when ever a read is done " \n This reverts commit 413c7c2cd82e09dac481ea52ba2cb88ffcd58624 as it introduced an regression when edge - triggered mode is used which is true for our native transports by default . With 413c7c2cd82e09dac481ea52ba2cb88ffcd58624 included it was possible that we set readPending to false by mistake even if we would be interested in read more .
Fix javadocs for ObjectUtil methods . \n Motivation : \n The javadocs for a few methds in ObjectUtil are not correct . \n Modifications : \n Add " not " where it was missing . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7455 ] .
Return the correct Future from FixedChannelPool . release ( ) \n Motivation : \n The behaviour of the FixedChannelPool . release was inconsistent with the \n SimpleChannelPool implementation , in that given promise is returned . \n In the FixedChannelPool implementation a new promise was return and \n this meant that the completion of that promise can be different . \n Specifically on releasing a channel to a closed pool , the parameter \n promise is failed with an IllegalStateException but the returned one \n will have been successful ( as it was completed by call to super \n . release ) \n Modification : \n Return the given promise as the result of FixedChannelPool . release \n Result : \n Returned promise will reflect the result of the release operation .
Remove @ deprecation keyword on AbstractUnsafe . ensureOpen ( . . . ) \n Motivation : \n e84567004324c0bfd04b0ca9e1e182ed89394b16 marked AbstractUnsafe . ensureOpen ( . . . ) as deprecated for no reason . \n Modifications : \n Remove ` @ deprecation ` \n Result : \n Remove incorrect annotation
Add testcase to ensure NioEventLoop . rebuildSelector ( ) works correctly . \n Motivation : \n We had recently a report that the issue [ # 6607 ] is still not fixed . \n Modifications : \n Add a testcase to prove the issue is fixed . \n Result : \n More tests .
Explicit specify hostaddress during tests to ensure testsuite pass on docker ( mac ) \n Motivation : \n When run the current testsuite on docker ( mac ) it will fail a few tests with : \n io . netty . channel . AbstractChannel $ AnnotatedConnectException : connect ( . . ) failed : Cannot assign requested address : / 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 : 0 % 0 : 46607 \n Caused by : java . net . ConnectException : connect ( . . ) failed : Cannot assign requested address \n Modifications : \n Specify host explicit as done in other tests to only use ipv6 when really supported . \n Result : \n Build pass on docker as well
Use array initializer expression \n Motivation : \n Code introduced in 6152990073607602b2263109139cf829f3d2f7e4 can be cleaned up and use array initializer expressions . \n Modifications : \n Use array initializer expressions . \n Result : \n Cleaner code .
Correct typo in artifactId of dependency in bom pom . xml \n Motivation : \n There was a typo in a dependency in the bom pom . xml which lead to have it specify a non - existing artifact and also so not have the maven release plugin update the version correctly . \n Modifications : \n Rename netty - transport - unix - common to netty - transport - native - unix - common and also fix the version . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 6979 ]

ExceptionInInitializerError .
Respect DNS port that is specified via JNDI \n Motivation : \n JNDI allows to specify an port so we should respect it . \n Modifications : \n Use the specified port and if none is specifed use 53 . \n Result : \n Correct handling of JNDI configured DNS .
Choose ipv4 or ipv6 google dns servers as default fallback based on the settings for this system / jvm \n Motivation : \n We should not use ipv4 google dns servers if the app is configured to run ipv6 . \n Modifications : \n Use either ipv4 or ipv6 dns servers depending on the system config . \n Result : \n More correct behaviour
DefaultChannelPipeline . estimatorHandle needs to be volatile \n Motivation : \n DefaultChannelPipeline . estimatorHandle needs to be volatile as its accessed from different threads . \n Modifications : \n Make DefaultChannelPipeline . estimatorHandle volatile and correctly init it via CAS \n Result : \n No more race .
First call channelReadComplete ( . . . ) before flush ( . . . ) for better performance \n Motivation : \n In Http2ConnectionHandler we call flush ( . . . ) in channelReadComplete ( . . . ) to ensure we update the flow - controller and write stuff to the remote peer . We should better flip the order and so may be able to pick up more bytes . \n Modifications : \n Change order of calls . \n Result : \n Better performance
Only flush on channelReadComplete ( . . . ) in http2 hello world examples . \n Motivation : \n In our http1 hello world example we only flush on channelReadComplete ( . . . ) to make better use of gathering writes . We should do the same in http2 . \n Modifications : \n Only flush in channelReadComplete ( . . . ) \n Result : \n Better performance and more consistent examples .
Fix false - positive leak detection report when ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine constructor throws . \n Motivation : \n We need to ensure we only create the ResourceLeak when the constructor not throws . \n Modifications : \n Ensure ResourceLeakDetector . track ( . . . ) is only called if the constructor of ReferenceCoundedOpenSslEngine not throws . \n Result : \n No more false - positves .
Add comment why the ResourceLeak creation is happening as last in the constructor . Followup of c5b5d363601a0d9ae294034c1e68a6de54a0958f
Ensure Http2FrameCodec uses Http2Settings . defaultSettings ( ) \n Motivation : \n Http2FrameCodec should use Http2Settings . defaultSettings ( ) when no Http2Settings were specified by the user . \n Modifications : \n Replace new Http2Settings ( ) with Http2Settings . defaultSettings ( ) \n Result : \n Use correct Http2Settings by default when using Http2FrameCodec in all cases .
Ensure we null out the previous set InetAddress on java . net . DatagramPacket when using OioDatagramChannel . \n Motivation : \n We need to ensure we always null out ( or set ) the address on the java . net . DatagramPacket when doing read or write operation as the same instance is used across different calls . \n Modifications : \n Null out the address if needed . \n Result : \n Ensure the correct remote address is used when connect / disconnect between calls and also mix these with calls that directly specify the remote address for adatagram packets .
Fix regression in detecting macOS / osx platform introduced by bdb0a39c8a01e934de4e0a75b073a0842d92a511
We should prefer heap buffers when using the OIO transport to reduce memory copies . \n Motivation : \n When using the OIO transport we need to act on byte [ ] when writing and reading from / to the underyling Socket . So we should ensure we use heap buffers by default to reduce memory copies . \n Modifications : \n Ensure we prefer heap buffers by default for the OIO transport . \n Result : \n Possible less memory copies .
Ensure netty builds with java9 ( build 9 + 181 ) \n Motivation : \n To be able to build with latest java9 release we need to adjust commons - lang version and maven - enforcer - plugin . \n Modifications : \n - Use commons - lang 2 . 6 . 0 \n - Use maven - enforcer - plugin 3 . 0 . 0 . M1 when building with java9 \n Result : \n Netty builds again with latest java9 release
Use the ByteBufAllocator when copy a ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf and so also be able to release it without the GC when the Cleaner is present . \n Motivation : \n In ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf . copy ( . . . ) we just allocated a ByteBuffer directly and wrapped it . This way it was not possible for us to free the direct memory that was used by the copy without the GC . \n Modifications : \n - Ensure we use the allocator when create the copy and so be able to release direct memory in a timely manner \n - Add unit test \n - Depending on if the to be copied buffer is direct or heap based we also allocate the same type on copy . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7103 ] .
Update netty - tcnative native library names to use underscores . \n Motivation : \n We recently changed netty - tcnative to use underscores in its native library names . \n Modifications : \n Update code to use underscores when loading native library . \n Result : \n More consistent code .
More bullet - proof way of detecting if ipv6 is supported or not when using native transport \n Motivation : \n We should try to bind to an ipv6 only socket before we enable ipv6 support in the native transport as it may not work due setup of the platform . \n Modifications : \n Try to bind to : : 1 use IPV6 later on if this works \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7021 ] .
Deprecate ApplicationProtocolNegotiator and its implementation as people should use ApplicationProtocolConfig \n Motivation : \n We should deprecate ApplicationProtocolNegotiator as the users should use ApplicationProtocolConfig these days . \n Modifications : \n Add deprecation annotations and javadocs . \n Result : \n Be able to make package - private in next major release .
Add Unit test for [ # 7143 ]
DefaultSocks5CommandRequest incorrectly rejects SOCKS5 commands with dstPort = 0 \n Motivation : \n According to SOCKS 5 spec , dstPort = 0 is a valid value in case of UDP ASSOCIATE . \n Modifications : \n - Allow 0 as port . \n - Add unit tests . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7156 ] .
Allow to construct UnpooledByteBufAllocator that explictly always use sun . misc . Cleaner \n Motivation : \n When the user want to have the direct memory explicitly managed by the GC ( just as java . nio does ) it is useful to be able to construct an UnpooledByteBufAllocator that allows this without the chances to see any memory leak . \n Modifications : \n Allow to explicitly disable the usage of reflection to construct direct ByteBufs and so be sure these will be collected by GC . \n Result : \n More flexible way to use the UnpooledByteBufAllocator .
Correctly filter out native tcnative lib \n Motivation : \n c93e58c453147ab5b34a708a85530d2372bbac81 changed to use _ for the tcnative lib name but missed to also adjust the filtering . \n Modifications : \n Fix filtering to look for _ \n Result : \n Not include native tcnative lib as expected .
Remove @ Deprecated from package - info . java as intellij not likes it
Fix regression in reporting leaks introduced by 3c8c7fc7e9c27f87e64aad5bd1df6c58ed8ef36e . \n Motivation : \n 3c8c7fc7e9c27f87e64aad5bd1df6c58ed8ef36e introduced some changes to the ResourceLeakDetector that introduced a regression and so would always log that paranoid leak detection should be enabled even it was already . \n Modifications : \n Correctly not clear the recorded stacktraces when we process the reference queue so we can log these . \n Result : \n ResourceLeakDetector works again as expected .
Check for latest centos release version when doing a release \n Motivation : \n We used to check for version 6 . 8 but the latest is 6 . 9 \n Modifications : \n Update version to 6 . 9 in the check . \n Result : \n Be able to cut a release on latest centos version
Set readPending to false when EOF is detected while issue an read \n Motivation : \n We need to set readPending to false when we detect a EOF while issue a read as otherwise we may not unregister from the Selector / Epoll / KQueue and so keep on receving wakeups . \n The important bit is that we may even get a wakeup for a read event but will still will only be able to read 0 bytes from the socket , so we need to be very careful when we clear the readPending . This can happen because we generally using edge - triggered mode for our native transports and because of the nature of edge - triggered we may schedule an read event just to find out there is nothing left to read atm ( because we completely drained the socket on the previous read ) . \n Modifications : \n Set readPending to false when EOF is detected . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7255 ] .
Only add / to uri if really needed . \n Motivation : \n We not need to include the start index in the check . See https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 6924 # discussion _ r125263918 \n Modifications : \n Change < = to < \n Result : \n More correct code .
Mark transport - rxtx as @ deprecated \n Motivation : \n transport - rxtx has no tests and there is really no easy way to add some . Beside this this transport is not really well maintained . \n Modifications : \n Mark transport - rxtx as @ deprecated so we can drop it in next major version . \n Result : \n Notify users of plan to drop the transport .
Add supresswarnings to cleanup 16b1dbdf9244f831aa0cd92d5531d8cb61010b07 . \n Motivation : \n We should add @ SupressWarnings \n Modifications : \n Add annotations . \n Result : \n Less warnings
Fix possible leak in SslHandler if wrap ( . . . ) throws . \n Motivation : \n We can end up with a buffer leak if SSLEngine . wrap ( . . . ) throws . \n Modifications : \n Correctly release the ByteBuf if SSLEngine . wrap ( . . . ) throws . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7337 ] .
Take the architecture into account when loading netty - tcnative \n Motivation : \n We should ensure we only try to load the netty - tcnative version that was compiled for the architecture we are using . \n Modifications : \n Include architecture into native lib name . \n Result : \n Only load native lib if the architecture is supported .
Ensure we call promise . setUncancellable ( ) before trying to process in DefaultHttp2StreamChannel . \n Motivation : \n We should call promise . setUncancellable ( ) in DefaultHttp2StreamChannel . Unsafe impl to detect if the operation was cancelled . \n Modifications : \n Add promise . setUncancellable ( ) calls \n Result : \n More correct handling of cancelled promises
Use the correct osname in the Bundle - NativeCode declaration . \n Motivation : \n We need to ensure we use the correct osname in the Bundle - NativeCode declaration as declared in : \n https : / / www . osgi . org / developer / specifications / reference / \n Modifications : \n Update osname to match the spec . \n Result : \n Correct Bundle - NativeCode entry in the MANIFEST
Ensure ThreadDeathWatcher and GlobalEventExecutor will not cause classloader leaks . \n Motivation : \n ThreadDeathWatcher and GlobalEventExecutor may create and start a new thread from various other threads and so inherit the classloader . We need to ensure we not inherit to allow recycling the classloader . \n Modifications : \n Use Thread . setContextClassLoader ( null ) to ensure we not hold a strong reference to the classloader and so not leak it . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7290 ] .
Don ' t try to use UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider when on Windows . \n Motivation : \n We should not try to use UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider when on Windows as it will log some error that will produce noise and may confuse users . \n Modifications : \n Just use DefaultDnsServerAddressStreamProvider if windows is used . \n Result : \n Less noise in the logs . This was reported in vert . x : https : / / github . com / eclipse / vert . x / issues / 2204
EpollSocketChannelConfig . getOptions ( ) must not throw if TCP _ FASTOPEN _ CONNECT is not supported \n Motivation : \n If a user calls EpollSocketChannelConfig . getOptions ( ) and TCP _ FASTOPEN _ CONNECT is not supported we throw an exception . \n Modifications : \n - Just return 0 if ENOPROTOOPT is set . \n - Add testcase \n Result : \n getOptions ( ) works as epxected .
Not directly call getsockopt but use exported helper function \n Motivation : \n To better isolate OS system calls we should not call getsockopt directly but use our netty _ unix _ socket _ getOption0 function . See is a followup of f115bf5 . \n Modifications : \n Export netty _ unix _ socket _ getOption0 by declaring it in the header file and use it \n Result : \n Better isolation of system calls .
Guard against NoClassDefFoundError when trying to load Unsafe . \n Motivation : \n OSGI and other enviroments may not allow to even load Unsafe which will lead to an NoClassDefFoundError when trying to access it . We should guard against this . \n Modifications : \n Catch NoClassDefFoundError when trying to load Unsafe . \n Result : \n Be able to use netty with a strict OSGI config .
Add tests for HttpObjectDecoder related to limits \n Motivation : \n HttpObjectDecoder will throw a TooLongFrameException when either the max size for the initial line or the header size was exceeed . We have no tests for this . \n Modifications : \n Add test cases . \n Result : \n More tests .
Not use safeRelease ( . . . ) but release ( . . . ) to release non - readable holders to ensure we not mask errors . \n Motivation : \n AbstractChannel attempts to " filter " messages which are written [ 1 ] . A goal of this process is to copy from heap to direct if necessary . However implementations of this method [ 2 ] [ 3 ] may translate a buffer with 0 readable bytes to EMPTY _ BUFFER . This may mask a user error where an empty buffer is written but already released . \n Modifications : \n Replace safeRelease ( . . . ) with release ( . . . ) to ensure we propagate reference count issues . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7383 ]
Remove WeakOrderedQueue from WeakHashMap when FastThreadLocal value was removed if possible . \n Motivation : \n We should remove the WeakOrderedQueue from the WeakHashMap directly if possible and only depend on the semantics of the WeakHashMap if there is no other way for us to cleanup it . \n Modifications : \n Override onRemoval ( . . . ) to remove the WeakOrderedQueue if possible . \n Result : \n Less overhead and quicker collection of WeakOrderedQueue for some cases .
Fix flacky test introduced by af2f343648f4cb3deca5314174e0e579f9fec846 \n Motivation : \n af2f343648f4cb3deca5314174e0e579f9fec846 introduced a test - case which was flacky due of multiple problems : \n - we called writeAndFlush ( . . . ) in channelRead ( . . . ) and assumed it will only be called once . This is true most of the times but it may be called multile times if the data is fragemented . \n - we didnt guard against the possibility that channelRead ( . . . ) is called with an empty buffer \n Modifications : \n - Call writeAndFlush ( . . . ) in channelActive ( . . . ) so we are sure its only called once and close the channel once we wrote the data \n - only compare the data after we received a close so we are sure there isnt anything extra received \n - check for exception and if we catched one fail the test . \n Result : \n No flacky test anymore and easier to debug issues that accour because of a catched exception .
Add a hint of ownership transfer when calling EmbeddedChannel . read * ( ) methods . \n Motivation : \n As shown in issues it is sometimes hard to understand why a leak was reported when the user just calles EmbeddedChannel . readInbound ( ) / EmbeddedChannel . readOutbound ( ) and drop the message on the floor . \n Modifications : \n Add a hint before handover the message to the user and transfer the ownership . \n Result : \n Easier debugging of leaks caused by EmbeddedChannel . read * ( ) .
Use 198 . 51 . 100 . 254 as BAD _ HOST for tests . \n Motivation : \n At the moment we use netty . io as BAD _ HOST with an port that we know is timing out . This may change in the future so we should better use 198 . 51 . 100 . 254 which is specified as " for documentation only " . \n Modifications : \n Replace netty . io with 198 . 51 . 100 . 254 in tests that depend on BAD _ HOST . \n Result : \n More future proof code .
Ensure ObjectCleaner will also be used when FastThreadLocal . set is used . \n Motivation : \n e329ca1 introduced the user of ObjectCleaner in FastThreadLocal but we missed the case to register our cleaner task if FastThreadLocal . set was called only . \n Modifications : \n - Use ObjectCleaner also when FastThreadLocal . set is used . \n - Add test case . \n Result : \n ObjectCleaner is always used .
ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf . memoryAddress ( ) should not throw \n Motivation : \n We need the memoryAddress of a direct buffer when using our native transports . For this reason ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf . memoryAddress ( ) should not throw . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly override ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf . memoryAddress ( ) and hasMemoryAddress ( ) \n - Add test case \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7672 ] .
Fix CharSequenceValueConverter . convertToByte implementation for AsciiString ( # 7994 ) \n Motivation : \n The implementation of CharSequenceValueConverter . convertToByte did not correctly handle AsciiString if the length ! = 1 . \n Modifications : \n - Only use fast - path for AsciiString with length of 1 . \n - Add unit tests . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7990
Adjust SSL related tests to be more correct and so pass in the next EA release of java11 . ( # 8162 ) \n Motivation : \n In some of our tests we not correctly init the SSLEngine before trying to perform a handshake which can cause an IllegalStateException . While this not happened in previous java releases it does now on Java11 ( which is " ok " as its even mentioned in the api docs ) . Beside this how we selected the ciphersuite to test renegotation was not 100 % safe . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly init SSLEngine before using it \n - Correctly select ciphersuite before testing for renegotation . \n Result : \n More correct tests and also pass on next java11 EA release .
Disable test as it sometimes fails on the CI \n Motivation : \n Temporary disable test that wwas introduced as part of f60d08fd32b7287f65077f99a88bac645834098f as it sometimes fail on the CI . We need to figure out why it fails there ( can not reproduce so far even on the CI after ssh into it ) . \n Modifications : \n Ignore test . \n Result : \n More stable builds until we figure out the flackyness .
Correctly implement SelectedSelectionKeySet . remove ( . . . ) / contains ( . . . ) again so it works with the NIO Selector . \n Motivation : \n c1a335446daf5892eab2e134538ba0388162f18b reimplemented remove ( . . . ) and contains ( . . . ) in a way which made it not work anymore when used by the Selector . \n Modifications : \n Partly revert changes in c1a335446daf5892eab2e134538ba0388162f18b . \n Result : \n Works again as expected
Correctly implement SelectedSelectionKeySet . Iterator remove ( ) \n Motivation : \n We need to implement remove ( ) by ourselves to make it work on Java7 as otherwise it will throw an AbstractMethodError . This is a followup of c1a335446daf5892eab2e134538ba0388162f18b . \n Modifications : \n Just implemented remove ( ) \n Result : \n Works on Java7 as well .
Fix concurrency issue in DnsNameResolver when DefaultDnsCache is used . \n Motivation : \n We need to ensure we only call List . * methods in the synchronized block as the returned List may not be thread - safe . \n Modifications : \n Do not call isEmpty ( ) outside of the synchronized block . \n Result : \n Fixes [ # 7583 ]
Provide a Docker image for reproducible builds \n Motivation : \n It would be good to provide a docker image for people that want to build netty on linux . \n Modifications : \n Add a docker file \n Result : \n People can more easily build netty . Fixes [ # 7585 ] .
Reduce overhead of cancel flowcontrolled writes . \n Motivation : \n When we cancel the flowcontrolled writes we did create a new StreamException for each write that was enqueued . Creating Exceptions is very expensive due of filling the stacktrace . \n Modifications : \n Only create the StreamException once and reuse the same for all the flowcontrolled writes ( per stream ) . \n Result : \n Less expensive to cancel flowcontrolled writes .
Ensure async failures are correctly propagated to Http2LifecycleManager . onError ( . . . ) in all cases . \n Motivation : \n If DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder process outbound operation it sometimes missed to call Http2LifecycleManager . onError ( . . . ) when the operation was executed asynchronously . \n Modifications : \n Make best effort to update flags but still ensure failures are propageted to Http2LifecycleManager . onError ( . . . ) in all cases . \n Result : \n More consistent handling of errors .
Reduce object allocation by using same ChannelFutureListener instance . \n Motivation : \n When VoidChannelPromise . unvoid ( ) was called we created a new ChannelFutureListener everytime . This is not needed as its stateless . \n Modifications : \n Reuse the ChannelFutureListener . \n Result : \n Less object allocations
ObjectCleanerThread must be a deamon thread to ensure the JVM can always terminate . \n Motivation : \n The ObjectCleanerThread must be a daemon thread as otherwise we may block the JVM from exit . By using a daemon thread we basically give the same garantees as the JVM when it comes to cleanup of resources ( as the GC threads are also daemon threads and the CleanerImpl uses a deamon thread as well in Java9 + ) . \n Modifications : \n Change ObjectCleanThread to be a daemon thread . \n Result : \n JVM shutdown will always be able to complete . Fixed [ # 7617 ] .

PlatformDependent . maxDirectMemory ( ) must respect io . netty . maxDirectMemory ( # 8452 ) \n Motivation : \n In netty we use our own max direct memory limit that can be adjusted by io . netty . maxDirectMemory but we do not take this in acount when maxDirectMemory ( ) is used . That will lead to non optimal configuration of PooledByteBufAllocator in some cases . \n This came up on stackoverflow : \n https : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 53097133 / why - is - default - num - direct - arena - derived - from - platformdependent - maxdirectmemory \n Modifications : \n Correctly respect io . netty . maxDirectMemory and so configure PooledByteBufAllocator correctly by default . \n Result : \n Correct value for max direct memory .
Make it clear that HashedWheelTimer only support millis . ( # 8322 ) \n Motivation : \n HWT does not support anything smaller then 1ms so we should make it clear that this is the case . \n Modifications : \n Log a warning if < 1ms is used . \n Result : \n Less suprising behaviour .
Don ' t double release ByteBuf when parsing of the X509Certificate fails ( # 8457 ) \n Motivation : \n Due a bug in our implementation we tried to release the same ByteBuf two times when we failed to parse the X509Certificate as closing the ByteBufInputStream already closed it . \n Modifications : \n - Don ' t close the ByteBuf when closing the ByteBufInputStream \n - Explicit release all ByteBufs after we are done parsing in a finally block . \n - Add testcase . \n Result : \n Do not produce an IllegalReferenceCountException and throw the correct CertificateException .
DefaultHeaders / CharSequenceValueConverter should treat boolean consistently . \n Motivation : \n HttpHeaders . getBoolean should return the same truth value for the same string value , regardless of the underlying type . \n Modifications : \n - Only treat values of true as Boolean .

Flush task should not flush messages that were written since last flush attempt . \n Motivation : \n The flush task is currently using flush ( ) which will have the affect of have the flush traverse the whole ChannelPipeline and also flush messages that were written since we gave up flushing . This is not really correct as we should only continue to flush messages that were flushed at the point in time when the flush task was submitted for execution if the user not explicit call flush ( ) by him / herself . \n Modification : \n Call * Unsafe . flush0 ( ) via the flush task which will only continue flushing messages that were marked as flushed before . \n Result : \n More correct behaviour when the flush task is used .
Call correct super methods in test . \n Motivation : \n We called the wrong super method in the test and also had a few unused imports . \n Modifications : \n Fix super method call and cleanup . \n Result : \n More correct test and cleanup .

Do not fail on runtime when an older version of Log4J2 is on the classpath . ( # 8240 ) \n Motivation : \n At the moment we will just assume the correct version of log4j2 is used when we find it on the classpath . This may lead to an AbstractMethodError at runtime . We should not use log4j2 if the version is not correct . \n Modifications : \n Check on class loading if we can use Log4J2 or not . \n Result : \n Fixes # 8217 .
Update to latest openjdk 12 ea release . ( # 8459 ) \n Motivation : \n We should always test against the latest EA release . \n Modifications : \n Update to openjdk 12 ea17 \n Result : \n Test against latest release
Correctly record creation stacktrace in ResourceLeakDetector . \n Motivation : \n We missed to correctly record the stacktrace of the creation of an ResourceLeak record . This could either have the effect to log the wrote stacktrace for creation or not log a stacktrace at all if the object was dropped on the floor after it was created . \n Modifications : \n Correctly create a Record on creation of the object . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7781 .
Correctly include the stream id when convert from Http2HeadersFrame to HttpMessage \n Motivation : \n We did not correctly set the stream id in the headers of HttpMessage when converting a Http2HeadersFrame . This is based on https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 7778 so thanks to @ jprante . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly set the id when possible in the header . \n - Add test case \n Result : \n Correctly include stream id .

In the handler we verify the number of messages we receive per read ( ) call but missed to sometimes reset the counter which resulted in exceptions . \n Modifications : \n Correctly reset read counter in all cases . \n Result : \n No more unexpected exceptions when running LocalChannel tests .
Enforce sane upper limit for TTL in DefaultDnsCache . ( # 7907 ) \n Motivation : \n In b47fb817991b42ec8808c7d26538f3f2464e1fa6 we limited the max supported delay to match what our internal implementat can support . Because of this it was possible that DefaultDnsCache produced an IllegalArgumentException when it tried to schedule a expiration > 3 years . \n Modifications : \n Limit the max supported TTL to 2 years which is safe for all our EventLoop implementations . \n Result : \n No more exceptions when adding records to the cache with a huge TTL .
Add test for caching failed queries in DefaultDnsCache . ( # 7909 ) \n Motivation : \n We had no test that validated the handling of caching failures for DefaultDnsCache . \n Modifications : \n Add testcase . \n Result : \n More tests FTW .

Update to OpenJDK 12 ea22 ( # 8618 ) \n Motivation : \n We should use the latest OpenJDK 12 release when running tests against Java12 . \n Modifications : \n - Update to OpenJDK 12 ea22 . \n - Update pax exam version \n - skip OSGI testsuite on Java12 as it does not work ea22 yet . \n Result : \n Use latest OpenJDK 12 version when running on the CI .
Fix IllegalReferenceCountException when using Http2MultiplexCodec and a DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame with a non empty ByteBuffer is received . ( # 7894 ) \n Motivation : \n We incorrectly called frame . release ( ) in onHttp2GoAwayFrame which could lead to IllegalReferenceCountExceptions . The call of release ( ) is inappropriate because the fireChannelRead ( ) in onHttp2Frame ( ) will handle it . \n Modifications : \n - Not call frame . release ( ) \n - Add a unit test \n Result : \n Fxies https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7892 .
Add # ifdef statements so the compilation of the native code not fails on MacOS ( # 7895 ) \n Motivation : \n b818852cdb0ee56ce3cf939e2faa538d519baabd added support for IP _ RECVORIGDSTADDR but did not include any # ifdef statements to ensure its usable at all ( which is not the case on MacOS ) . \n Modifications : \n Add # ifdef statements to check for IP _ RECVORIGDSTADDR . \n Result : \n Compilation works again on MacOS .
Add testcase for c11b23bbc1f46116407bdc10779c4cace639ee83 \n Motivation : \n c11b23bbc1f46116407bdc10779c4cace639ee83 added a fix for closing the SSLEngine otbound but no test was provided . \n Modifications : \n Add testcase . \n Result : \n More tests .
PlatformDependent0 should be able to better detect if unaligned access is supported on java9 and later . ( # 8255 ) \n Motivation : \n In Java8 and earlier we used reflection to detect if unaligned access is supported . This fails in Java9 and later as we would need to change the accessible level of the method . \n Lucky enough we can use Unsafe directly to read the content of the static field here . \n Modifications : \n Add special handling for detecting if unaligned access is supported on Java9 and later which does not fail due jigsaw . \n Result : \n Better and more correct detection on Java9 and later .
NioEventLoop should also use our special SelectionKeySet on Java9 and later . ( # 8260 ) \n Motivation : \n In Java8 and earlier we used reflection to replace the used key set if not otherwise told . This does not work on Java9 and later without special flags as its not possible to call setAccessible ( true ) on the Field anymore . \n Modifications : \n - Use Unsafe to instrument the Selector with out special set when sun . misc . Unsafe is present and we are using Java9 + . \n Result : \n NIO transport produce less GC on Java9 and later as well .
Allow to generate a jmh uber jar to run benchmarks easily from cmdline with different arguments . ( # 8264 ) \n Motivation : \n It is sometimes useful to be able to run benchmarks easily from the commandline and passs different arguments / options here . We should support this . \n Modifications : \n Add the benchmark - jar profile which allows to generate such an " uber - jar " that can be used directly to run benchmarks as documented at http : / / openjdk . java . net / projects / code - tools / jmh / . \n Result : \n More flexible way to run benchmarks .
Remove flags when running benchmarks . ( # 8262 ) \n Motivation : \n Some of the flags we used are not supported anymore on more recent JDK versions . We should just remove all of them and only keep what we really need . This may also reflect better what people use in production . \n Modifications : \n Remove some flags when running the benchmarks . \n Result : \n Benchmarks also run with JDK11 .
PemPrivateKey . toPem ( . . . ) should throw IllegalArgumentException when P… ( # 8253 ) \n * PemPrivateKey . toPem ( . . . ) should throw IllegalArgumentException when PrivateKey which does not support encoding is used . \n Motivation : \n At the moment when a PrivateKey is used that does not support encoding we throw a NPE when trying to convert the key . We should better throw an IllegalArgumentException with the details about what key we tried to encode . \n Modifications : \n - Check if PrivateKey . getEncoded ( ) returns null and if so throw an IllegalArgumentException \n - Add unit test . \n Result : \n Better handling of non - supported PrivateKey implementations .
NioEventLoop . register ( . . . ) should offload to the EventLoop if not alr… ( # 8612 ) \n Motivation : \n java . nio . channels . spi . AbstractSelectableChannel . register ( . . . ) need to obtain multiple locks during execution which may produce a long wait time if we currently select . This lead to multiple CI failures in the past . \n Modifications : \n Ensure the register call takes place on the EventLoop . \n Result : \n No more flacky CI test timeouts .
Add docker - sync files to . gitignore
Correctly clear the error stack in all cases when using ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine . ( # 7941 ) \n Motivation : \n We missed to correctly clear the error stack in one case when using the ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine . Because of this it was possible to pick up an error on an unrelated operation . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly clear the stack \n - Add verification of empty error stack to tests . \n Result : \n Not possible to observe unrelated errors .
Adjust tests to also pass when using BoringSSL ( # 7946 ) \n Motivation : \n Some of the tests failed when using BoringSSL as some protocol / cipher combinations are not supported and it uses a different alert when the cert is not valid yet . \n Modification : \n - Remove protocol / cipher combos that are not supported by BoringSSL \n - Test for different alert when using BoringSSL \n Result : \n Not test failures when using BoringSSL .
Add missing parameter when delegate to SSLEngine . \n Motivation : \n https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 7943 had a bug which caused to not have the argument passed to the delegating method . \n Modifications : \n Add argument to release call . \n Result : \n Correctly delegate method .
Guard against calling malloc ( 0 ) when create ByteBuffer . ( # 7948 ) \n Motivation : \n We did not guard against the case of calling malloc ( 0 ) when creating a ByteBuffer without a Cleaner . The problem is that malloc ( 0 ) can have different behaviour , it either return a null - pointer or a valid pointer that you can pass to free . \n The real problem arise if Unsafe . allocateMemory ( 0 ) returns 0 and we use it as the memoryAddress of the ByteBuffer . The problem here is that native libraries test for 0 and handle it as a null - ptr . This is for example true in SSL . bioSetByteBuffer ( . . . ) which would throw a NPE when 0 is used as memoryAddress and so produced errors during SSL usage . \n Modifications : \n - Always allocate 1 byte as minimum ( even if we ask for an empty buffer ) . \n - Add unit test . \n Result : \n No more errors possible because of malloc ( 0 ) .
Update to conscrypt 1 . 1 . 2 ( # 7949 ) \n Motivation : \n We use latest conscrypt to test against . \n Modifications : \n Update to conscrypt 1 . 1 . 2 \n Result : \n Use latest conscrypt release .
Revert workaround in test for Java 11 as it produces a connection - reset as expected now . ( # 7951 ) \n Motivation : \n We added a workaround for Java 11 as it not produced a connect - reset when SO _ LINGER with 0 was set and NIO was used . This was fixed in the latest ea release of Java 11 : \n - http : / / hg . openjdk . java . net / jdk / jdk / rev / ea54197f4fe4 \n - https : / / bugs . openjdk . java . net / browse / JDK - 8203059 \n Modifications : \n Revert workaround . \n Result : \n Test that Java 11 behave the same way as earlier Java versions again .
Fixed | SimpleChannelPool . close ( ) should only return after complete . ( # 7927 ) \n Motivation : \n We need to ensure we only return from close ( ) after all work is done as otherwise we may close the EventExecutor before we dispatched everything . \n Modifications : \n Correctly wait on operations to complete before return . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7901 .
AUTO _ CLOSE should not be marked as deprecated . ( # 7967 ) \n Motivation : \n A long time ago we deprecated AUTO _ CLOSE but it turned out this feature is still useful because if a write error is detected there still maybe data to read , and if we close the channel automatically we will lose data \n Modifications : \n - Remove ` @ Deprecated ` tag for AUTO _ CLOSE , setAutoClose ( . . . ) and isAutoClose ( . . . ) \n - Fix javadocs on ChannelConfig to correctly tell the default value of AUTO _ CLOSE . \n Result : \n Less warnings .
Don ' t use VM . maxDirectMemory ( ) on IBM J9 / Eclipse OpenJ9 to retrieve direct memory limit ( # 7966 ) \n Motivation : \n On J9 / OpenJ9 netty initializes this value with 64M , even the direct accessible memory is actually unbounded . \n Modifications : \n Skip usage of VM . maxDirectMemory ( ) on J9 / OpenJ9 \n Result : \n More correct direct memory limit detection . Fixes # 7654 .
Use jdk - 11 - ea + 15 when try to build with java11 ( # 7979 ) \n Motivation : \n A new EA build for java 11 is out . \n Modifications : \n Update from ea + 14 to ea + 15 \n Result : \n Use latest ea build
Correctly let Http2UnkownFrame extend HttpStreamFrame and so be usable with Http2MultiplexCodec . ( # 7976 ) \n Motivation : \n This is a followup for # 7860 . In the fix for # 7860 we only partly fixed the problem as Http2UnknownFrame did not correctly extend HttpStreamFrame and so only worked when using the Http2FrameCodec . We need to have it extend HttpStreamFrame as otherwise Http2MultiplexCodec will reject to handle it correctly . \n Modifications : \n - Let Http2UnknownFrame extend HttpStreamFrame \n - Add unit tests for writing and reading Http2UnkownFrame instances when the Http2MultiplexCodec is used . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7969 .
Don ' t trim stacktrace for exceptions when running mvn test ( # 7981 ) \n Motivation : \n The maven surefire plugin will trim stacktraces by default which makes these kind of use - less when trying to understand why an test failed because one was thrown . \n Modifications : \n Configure the plugin to not trim the stacktrace . \n Result : \n Easier to debug test - failures .
Ignore some test - flakiness when using Java11 + due outstanding Java11 bug . ( # 7984 ) \n Motivation : \n Java11 disallow draining any remaining bytes from the socket if a write causes a connection reset . This should be completely safe to do . At the moment if a write is causing a connection - reset you basically loose all the pending bytes that are sitting on the socket and are waiting to be read . \n This happens because SocketOutputStream . write ( … ) may call AbstractPlainSocketImpl . setConnectionReset ( … ) . Once this method is called any read ( … ) call will just throw a SocketException without even attempt to read any remaining data . \n This is related : \n - https : / / bugs . openjdk . java . net / browse / JDK - 8199329 \n - http : / / hg . openjdk . java . net / jdk / jdk / rev / 92cca24c8807 \n - http : / / mail . openjdk . java . net / pipermail / net - dev / 2018 - May / 011511 . html \n Modifications : \n Tolarate if remaining bytes could not be read when using OIO . \n Result : \n Be able to build Netty and run testsuite while using Java11
Also clear the authoritativeDnsServerCache when closing the Channel . ( # 8174 ) \n Motivation : \n At the moment we only clear the resolveCache when the Channel is closed . We should also do the same for the authoritativeDnsServerCache . \n Modifications : \n Add authoritativeDnsServerCache . clear ( ) to the Channel closeFuture . \n Result : \n Correctly clear all caches .
Update to jmh 1 . 2 . 1 ( # 8270 ) \n Motivation : \n We should use the latest jmh version which also supports - prof dtraceasm on MacOS . \n Modifications : \n Update to latest jmh version . \n Result : \n Better benchmark / profiling support on MacOS .
Skip test on windows as the semantics we expect are only true on Linux / Unix / BSD / MacOS ( # 8629 ) \n Motivation : \n In the test we assume some semantics on how RST is done that are not true for Windows so we should skip it . \n Modifications : \n Skip test when on windows . \n Result : \n Be able to run testsuite on windows . Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 8571 .

Also remove the id from the DnsQueryContextManager if query fails due parent Channel activation error . \n Motivation : \n Whenever we fail the query we should also remove the id from the DnsQueryContextManager . \n Modifications : \n Remove the id from the DnsQueryContextManager if we fail the query because the channel failed to become active . \n Result : \n More correct code .
OpenSSL ( and so netty - tcnative ) should allow to use custom engine . ( # 8050 ) \n Motivation : \n OpenSSL allows to use a custom engine for its cryptographic operations . We should allow the user to make use of it if needed . \n See also : https : / / www . openssl . org / docs / man1 . 0 . 2 / crypto / engine . html . \n Modifications : \n Add new system property which can be used to specify the engine to use ( null is the default and will use the build in default impl ) . \n Result : \n More flexible way of using OpenSSL .
Update to netty - tcnative 2 . 0 . 12 . Final ( # 8073 ) \n Motivation : \n A new version of tcnative was released that allows to use features depending on the runtime version of openssl , which makes it possible to use KeyManagerFactory and hostname verification on newer versions of centos / fedora / rhel and debian / ubuntu without the need to compile again . \n Modifications : \n Update to 2 . 0 . 12 . Final \n Result : \n Use latest version of netty - tcnative to support more features .
Only try to call SSL . setHostnameValidation ( . . . ) if needed . ( # 8074 ) \n Motivation : \n As the used OpenSSL version may not support hostname validation we should only really call SSL . setHostNameValidation ( . . . ) if we detect that its needed . \n Modifications : \n Only call SSL . setHostNameValidation if it was disabled before and now it needs to be enabled or if it was enabled before and it should be disabled now . \n Result : \n Less risk of an exception when using an OpenSSL version that does not support hostname validation .
Add test to validate SSLEngine does not zero out src buffer on wrap . ( # 7914 ) \n Motivation : \n We had a bug - report that claimed the src buffer used by OpenSslEngine will be zero out . \n Modifications : \n Add testcase to ensure correct behaviour \n Result : \n Testcase for https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7753
Directly init refCnt to 1 ( # 8274 ) \n Motivation : \n We should just directly init the refCnt to 1 and not use the AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater . \n Modifications : \n Just assing directly to 1 . \n Result : \n Cleaner code and possible a bit faster as the JVM / JIT may be able to optimize the first store easily .
Override and so delegate all methods in OpenSslX509Certificate ( # 8472 ) \n Motivation : \n We did not override all methods in OpenSslX509Certificate and delegate to the internal 509Certificate . \n Modifications : \n Add missing overrides . \n Result : \n More correct implementation
Fix typo in MessageToMessageDecoder api docs . ( # 8638 ) \n Motivation : \n We had some typo ( most likely caused by copy - and - paste ) in the api docs which should be fixed . \n Modifications : \n Replace encoder by decoder word . \n Result : \n Correct apidocs .

Fix NPE that was encounter by debugger ( will never happen in real code ) . ( # 8992 ) \n Motivation : \n We synchronize on the chunk . arena when produce the String returned by PoolSubpage . toString ( ) which may raise a NPE when chunk = = null . Chunk = = null for the head of the linked - list and so a NPE may raised by a debugger . This NPE can never happen in real code tho as we never access toString ( ) of the head . \n Modifications : \n Add null checks and so fix the possible NPE \n Result : \n No NPE when using a debugger and inspect the PooledByteBufAllocator .
Enforce ratioMask also for WeakOrderQueue ( # 9727 ) \n Motivation : \n At the moment we only enfore ratioMask for the Stack which means that we only guard against recycle burts when recycled from the same Thread . We should also enforce the ratioMask in the WeakOrderQueue so we also guard against the bursts when recycle from other threads . \n Modifications : \n - Keep counter in WeakOrderQueue to enforce ratioMask as well \n - Adjust unit test \n Result : \n Better guard against recycle bursts which could pollute the heap unnecessary .
Use OpenJDK 12 EA 27 when running CI jobs for JDK 12 . ( # 8715 ) \n Motivation : \n A new EA release was done for OpenJDK12 . \n Modifications : \n Use OpenJDK12 EA 27 when running CI jobs for JDK 12 . \n Result : \n Test against latest OpenJDK 12 EA build .

Fix flaky ChannelInitializerTest . testChannelInitializerEventExecutor ( ) ( # 8738 ) \n Motivation : \n testChannelInitializerEventExecutor ( ) did sometimes fail as we sometimes miss to count down the latch . This can happen when we remove the handler from the pipeline before channelUnregistered ( . . . ) was called for it . \n Modifications : \n Countdown the latch in handlerRemoved ( . . . ) . \n Result : \n Fix flaky test .
Fix AppendableCharSequence . subSequence ( . . . ) where start = = end . ( # 8798 ) \n Motivation : \n To conform to the CharSequence interface we need to return an empty CharSequence when start = = end index and a subSequence is requested . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly handle the case where start = = end \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n Fix https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 8796 .
Reduce direct memory overhead per EpollEventLoop when using EpollDatagramChannel ( # 8825 ) \n Motivation : \n When using a linux distribution that supports sendmmsg ( . . . ) we allocated enough direct memory per EpollEventLoop to be able to write IOV _ MAX number of iovecs per message that can be written per sendmmsg . \n The number of messages that can be written per sendmmsg ( . . . ) call is limited by UIO _ MAX _ IOV . \n In practice this resulted in an allocation of 16MB direct memory per EpollEventLoop instance that stayed allocated until the EpollEventLoop was shutdown which happens as part of the shutdown of the enclosing EpollEVentLoopGroup . \n This resulted in quite some heavy direct memory usage in practice even when in practice we have very slim changes to ever need all of the memory . \n Modification : \n Adjust NativeDatagramPacketArray to share one IovArray instance across all NativeDatagramPacket instances it holds . This limits the max number of iovecs we can write across all messages to IOV _ MAX per sendmmsg ( . . . ) call . \n This in practice will still be enough to allow us to write multiple messages with one syscall while keep the memory overhead to a minimum . \n Result : \n Smaller direct memory footprint per EpollEventLoop when using EpollDatagramChannel on distributions that support sendmmsg ( . . . ) . \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 8814
Add @ SupressWarnings ( " deprecation " ) to ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter and clarify deprecation in ChannelHandler ( # 9001 ) \n Motivation : \n https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 8826 added @ Deprecated to the exceptionCaught ( . . . ) method but we missed to add @ SupressWarnings ( . . . ) to it ' s sub - types . Beside this we can make the deprecated docs a bit more clear . \n Modifications : \n - Add @ SupressWarnings ( " deprecated " ) \n - Clarify docs . \n Result : \n Less warnings and more clear deprecated docs .
Do not depend on the implementation detail of Unpooled . buffer ( int ) when accessing backing array . ( # 8865 ) \n Motivation : \n We should not depend on the implementation detail of Unpooled . buffer ( int ) to allocate the exact size of backing byte [ ] as depending on the implementation it may return a buffer with a bigger backing array . \n Modifications : \n Explicit allocate the byte [ ] and wrap it in the ByteBuf . This way we are sure that ByteBuf . array ( ) returns an byte [ ] which has the exact length and content we expect . \n Result : \n More correct and safe usage of ByteBuf . array ( )
Don ' t deregister Channel as part of closing it when using native kqueue transport ( # 8881 ) \n Motivation : \n In https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 8665 we changed how we handle the registration of Channels to KQueue but missed to removed some code which would deregister the Channel before it actual closed the underlying socket . This could lead to have events triggered still while not have a mapping to the Channel anymore . \n Modifications : \n Remove deregister call during socket closure . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 8849 .
Add test for Iterator . remove ( ) on KObjectHashMap . values ( ) . iterator ( ) ( # 8891 ) \n Motivation : \n https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 8866 added support for calling Iterator . remove ( ) but did not add a testcase . \n Modifications : \n Add testcase to ensure removal works . \n Result : \n Better test - coverage .

This could lead to stales , which showed up during tests when running with Java11 and BoringSSL . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly resume wrap / unwrap in all cases . \n - Fix timeout value which was changed in previous commit by mistake . \n Result : \n No more stales after task execution .
ByteToMessageDecoder . handlerRemoved ( . . . ) should only call fireChannelReadComplete ( ) if fireChannelRead ( . . . ) was called before ( # 9211 ) \n Motivation : \n At the moment ByteToMessageDecoder always calls fireChannelReadComplete ( ) when the handler is removed from the pipeline and the cumulation buffer is not null . We should only call it when we also call fireChannelRead ( . . . ) , which only happens if the cumulation buffer is not null and readable . \n Modifications : \n Only call fireChannelReadComplete ( ) if fireChannelRead ( . . . ) is called before during removal of the handler . \n Result : \n More correct semantics
Allow null sender when using DatagramPacketEncoder ( # 9204 ) \n Motivation : \n It is valid to use null as sender so we should support it when DatagramPacketEncoder checks if it supports the message . \n Modifications : \n - Add null check \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9199 .
Remove - - add - opens = java . base / java . nio = ALL - UNNAMED when running tests as it is not needed anymore since a long time ( # 8934 ) \n Motivation : \n At some point we needed - - add - opens = java . base / java . nio = ALL - UNNAMED to run our native tests but this is not true anymore . \n Modifications : \n Remove - - add - opens = java . base / java . nio = ALL - UNNAMED when running native tests . \n Result : \n Remove obsolate jvm arg .
Fail build when Illegal reflective access is detected ( # 8933 ) \n Motivation : \n We want to make the experience as smooth as possible for our users when using Java9 + and so should ensure we do not produce any ' Illegal reflective access ' errors when using netty . \n Modifications : \n Add jvmArgs when running our tests that will deny reflective access and so will fail the build at the end due not be able to load some classes . \n Result : \n Ensure we do not produce any illegal refelctive access errors when using java9 +
Fix typo in NativeLibraryLoader debug log message ( # 8947 ) \n Motivation : \n We had a typo in NativeLibraryLoader debug log message which could misslead the user . \n Modifications : \n Fix typo to correctly state java . library . path \n Result : \n Correct and less confusing log message

Correctly handle http2 upgrades when Http2FrameCodec is used together… ( # 9318 ) \n Motivation : \n In the latest release we introduced Http2MultiplexHandler as a replacement of Http2MultiplexCodec . This did split the frame parsing from the multiplexing to allow a more flexible way to handle frames and to make the code cleaner . Unfortunally we did miss to special handle this in Http2ServerUpgradeCodec and so did not correctly add Http2MultiplexHandler to the pipeline before calling Http2FrameCodec . onHttpServerUpgrade ( . . . ) . This did lead to the situation that we did not correctly receive the event on the Http2MultiplexHandler and so did not correctly created the Http2StreamChannel for the upgrade stream . Because of this we ended up with an NPE if a frame was dispatched to the upgrade stream later on . \n Modifications : \n - Correctly add Http2MultiplexHandler to the pipeline before calling Http2FrameCodec . onHttpServerUpgrade ( . . . ) \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9314 .
Prevent any leaks when HttpPostStandardRequestDecoder constructor throws ( # 9837 ) \n Motivation : \n HttpPostStandardRequestDecoder may throw multiple different exceptions in the constructor which could lead to memory leaks .

Use ResolvedAddressTypes . IPV4 _ ONLY in DnsNameResolver by default if n… ( # 9048 ) \n Motivation : \n To closely mimic what the JDK does we should not try to resolve AAAA records if the system itself does not support IPv6 at all as it is impossible to connect to this addresses later on . In this case we need to use ResolvedAddressTypes . IPV4 _ ONLY . \n Modifications : \n Add static method to detect if IPv6 is supported and if not use ResolvedAddressTypes . IPV4 _ ONLY . \n Result : \n More consistent behaviour between JDK and our resolver implementation .
Correctly calculate ttl for AuthoritativeNameServer when update existing records ( # 9051 ) \n Motivation : \n We did not correctly calculate the new ttl as we did forget to add ` this . ` \n Modifications : \n Add . this and so correctly calculate the TTL \n Result : \n Use correct TTL for authoritative nameservers when updating these .
Only try to use OpenSslX509TrustManagerWrapper when using Java 7 + ( # 9065 ) \n Motivation : \n We should only try to use OpenSslX509TrustManagerWrapper when using Java 7 + as otherwise it fail to init in it ' s static block as X509ExtendedTrustManager was only introduced in Java7 \n Modifications : \n Only call OpenSslX509TrustManagerWrapper if we use Java7 + \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9064 .
Throw SignatureException if OpenSslPrivateKeyMethod . * return null to prevent segfault ( # 9100 ) \n Motivation : \n While OpenSslPrivateKeyMethod . * should never return null we should still guard against it to prevent any possible segfault . \n Modifications : \n - Throw SignatureException if null is returned \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n No segfault when user returns null .

Http2MultiplexCodec . DefaultHttp2StreamChannel should handle ChannelConfig . isAutoClose ( ) in a consistent way as AbstractChannel ( # 9108 ) \n Motivation : \n Http2MultiplexCodec . DefaultHttp2StreamChannel currently only act on ClosedChannelException exceptions when checking for isAutoClose ( ) . We should widen the scope here to IOException to be more consistent with AbstractChannel . \n Modifications : \n Replace instanceof ClosedChannelException with instanceof IOException \n Result : \n More consistent handling of isAutoClose ( )
Always include classes from all native transports no matter on which platfrom netty - all is build ( # 9111 ) \n Motivation : \n While building netty - all we should always include all classes for native transports no matter if the native part can be build or not . This was it is easier to test locally with a installed snapshot of netty - all when the code that uses it does enable a specific native transport depending on if the native bits can be loaded or not . \n Modifications : \n Always include classes of native transports no matter on which platfrom we build . When a release is done we ensure we include the native bits by using the uber - staging profile . \n Result : \n Easier testing with netty - all snapshots .
Always include initial handshake exception when throwing SslHandshakeException ( # 9008 ) \n Motivation : \n A callback may already have stored a initial handshake exception in ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine so we should include it when throwing a SslHandshakeException to ensure the user has all the infos when debugging . \n Modifications : \n Include initial handshake exception \n Result : \n Include all erros when throwing the SslHandshakeException .
Deprecate ChannelOption . newInstance ( . . . ) ( # 8997 ) \n Motivation : \n Deprecate ChannelOption . newInstance ( . . . ) as it is not used . \n Modifications : \n Deprecate ChannelOption . newInstance ( . . . ) as valueOf ( . . . ) should be used as a replacement . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 8983 .

Set the HOST header in Http2ClientInitializer when trying to start an upgrade request ( # 9177 ) \n Motivation : \n The io . netty . example . http2 . helloworld . client . Http2Client example should work in the h2c ( HTTP2 cleartext - non - TLS ) mode , which is the default for this example unless you set a - Dssl VM param . As we do not set the HOST header some servers do reject the upgrade request . \n Modifications : \n Set the HOST header \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9115 .
Reduce object creation on Http2FrameCodec ( # 9333 ) \n Motivation : \n We don ' t need the extra ChannelPromise when writing headers anymore in Http2FrameCodec . This also means we cal re - use a ChannelFutureListener and so not need to create new instances all the time . \n Modifications : \n - Just pass the original ChannelPromise when writing headers \n - Reuse the ChannelFutureListener \n Result : \n Two less objects created when writing headers for an not - yet created stream .
Correctly close ` EmbeddedChannel ` and release buffers in ` SnappyFrameDecoderTest ` ( # 9851 ) \n Motivation : \n We did not correctly close the ` EmbeddedChannel ` which would lead to not have ` handlerRemoved ( . . . ) ` called . This can lead to leaks . Beside this we also did not correctly consume produced data which could also show up as a leak . \n Modifications : \n - Always call ` EmbeddedChannel . finish ( ) ` \n - Ensure we consume all produced data and release it \n Result : \n No more leaks in test . This showed up in https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 9850 # issuecomment - 562504863 .
Fix flaky DnsNameResolverTest . testTruncatedWithTcpFallback ( # 9262 ) \n Motivation : \n testTruncatedWithTcpFallback was flacky as we may end up closing the socket before we could read all data .

Remove usage of forbiddenHttpRequestResponder ( # 9941 ) \n Motivation : \n At the moment we add a handler which will respond with 403 forbidden if a websocket handshake is in progress ( and after ) . This makes not much sense as it is unexpected to have a remote peer to send another http request when the handshake was started . In this case it is much better to let the websocket decoder bail out . \n Modifications : \n Remove usage of forbiddenHttpRequestResponder \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9913
SslHandler . wrap ( . . . ) must ensure it not loose the original exception when finishWrap ( . . . ) fails ( # 9974 ) \n Motivation : \n When SslHandler . finishWrap throws an exception , ensure that the promise and buf is not reused to avoid throwing IllegalArgumentException or IllegalReferenceCountException which causes the original exception to be lost . \n Modification : \n The change ensures that the values for the promise and bytebuf are nulled before calling finishWrap so that it will not be called again with the same arguments . \n Result : \n Fixes # 9971 . \n Co - authored - by : Norman Maurer < norman _ maurer @ apple . com > \n Co - authored - by : Antony T Curtis < atcurtis @ gmail . com >

Correctly calculate the initial size of the LinkedHashMap during DefaultChannelGroup . write * ( # 10055 ) \n Motivation : \n We should not include the number of ServerChannel that are part of the DefaultChannelGroup when specify the initial size of the LinkedHashMap \n Modifications : \n Only use the number of the non ServerChannel \n Result : \n Reduce memory - footprint
NetworkInterface . getByInetAddress ( ) may return null on Android platform ( # 10056 ) \n Motivation : \n NetworkInterface . getByInetAddress ( ) may return null on Android . This is incorrect by the API but still happens . To help our users we should provide a workaround \n Modifications : \n Just return an empty Enumeration when null is returned . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10045
Add SslHandshakeTimeoutException and use it for handshake timeouts ( # 10062 ) \n Motivation : \n Often it is useful to be able to detect different sorts of SSL errors that cause the handshake to fail . To make this easier we should throw and explicit exception type for handshake timeouts . \n Modifications : \n - Add SslHandshakeTimeoutException ( which extends SSLHandshakeException ) and use it for handshake timeouts \n - Adjust testcases \n Result : \n Easier to detect that handshake failed because of a timeout
PromiseTask . isCancelled performs an unsynchronized read ( # 10066 ) \n Motivation : \n PromiseTask . isCancelled performs an unsynchronized read and so may trigger race - detectors . As this was just done for a small optimization which should not really make a lot of difference we should just remove it . \n Modifications : \n Remove unsynchronized read optimization \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10026 .

Add workaround for possible classloader deadlock when trying to load JNI code ( # 10190 ) \n Motivation : \n netty _ epoll _ linuxsocket _ JNI _ OnLoad ( . . . ) may produce a deadlock with another thread that will load IOUtil in a static block . This seems to be a JDK bug which is not yet fixed . To workaround this we force IOUtil to be loaded from without java code before init the JNI code \n Modifications : \n Use Selector . open ( ) as a workaround to load IOUtil \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10187
Clarify exception message when ALPN is not supported ( # 10155 ) \n Motivation : \n We should provide more informations when ALPN is not supported and a user tries to use it . \n Modifications : \n - Use UnsupportedOperationException \n Result : \n Easier to debug ALPN problems
HTTP2 : Guard against multiple ctx . close ( . . . ) calls with the same ChannelPromise ( # 10201 ) \n Motivation : \n Http2ConnectionHandler may call ctx . close ( . . . ) with the same promise instance multiple times if the timeout for gracefulShutdown elapse and the listener itself is notified . This can cause problems as other handlers in the pipeline may queue these promises and try to notify these later via setSuccess ( ) or setFailure ( . . . ) which will then throw an IllegalStateException if the promise was notified already \n Modification : \n - Add boolean flag to ensure doClose ( ) will only try to call ctx . close ( . . . ) one time \n Result : \n Don ' t call ctx . close ( . . . ) with the same promise multiple times when gradefulShutdown timeout elapses .
Add fastpath implementation for Unpooled . copiedBuffer ( CharSequence , Charset ) when UTF - 8 or US - ASCII is used ( # 10206 ) \n Motivation : \n We can make use of our optimized implementations for UTF - 8 and US - ASCII if the user request a copy of a sequence for these charsets \n Modifications : \n - Add fastpath implementation \n - Add unit tests \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10205
Don ' t log with warn level in the DnsNameResolver in most cases ( # 10225 ) \n Motivation : \n We should only log with warn level if something really critical happens as otherwise we may spam logs and confuse the user . \n Modifications : \n - Change log level to debug for most cases \n Result : \n Less noisy logging
Fix memory leak in HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder ( # 10227 ) \n Motivation : \n We need to release all ByteBufs that we allocate to prevent leaks . We missed to release the ByteBufs that are used to aggregate in two cases \n Modifications : \n Add release ( ) calls \n Result : \n No more memory leak in HttpPostMultipartRequestDecoder
Remove some debugging cruft ( # 10229 ) \n Motivation : \n RtspDecoderTest did include a println ( . . . ) call which was a left over from debugging . \n Modifications : \n Remove println ( . . . ) \n Result : \n Cleanup

( # 9993 ) \n Motivation : \n 42aa7f0c58375c6fcdc9a3ed26b431999c63c6c7 did update the checkstyle version but missed that we declared it explicitly in the all artifact as well . \n Modifications : \n Remove explicit definition in the all artifact . \n Result : \n Use latest checkstyle version everywhere .
Use correct system property name in PooledByteBufAllocator ( io . netty . allocator . cacheTrimIntervalMillis ) ( # 9994 ) \n Motivation : \n We had a typo in the system property name that was used to lookup the cache trime interval . We should ensure we use the correct naming when lookup the property \n Modifications : \n - Support the old and the new ( correct ) naming of the property when configure the cache trim interval . \n - Log something if someone uses the old ( deprecated ) name \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9981
Update ProtocolDetectionResult to fix typo ( # 10086 ) \n Motivation : \n Correct a typo . \n Modification : \n Changed a name of a private constant variable , ' NEEDS _ MORE _ DATE ' to ' NEEDS _ MORE _ DATA ' \n Result : \n Cleanup
Ensure we don ' t leak the ClassLoader in the backtrace of TrackRecord . BOTTOM ( # 10839 ) \n Motivation : \n We need to ensure we override fillInStacktrace ( ) when we store exceptions in static fields to not leak the Classloader in the backtrace . \n Came up in https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 10691 # issuecomment - 738331186 . Thanks to @ amir - shalem for notice this one . \n Modifications : \n - Add overrides of fillInStracktrace in TrackRecord .

Respect jdk . tls . client . enableSessionTicketExtension and jdk . tls . server . enableSessionTicketExtension when using native SSL impl ( # 10296 ) \n Motivation : \n We should respect jdk . tls . client . enableSessionTicketExtension and jdk . tls . server . enableSessionTicketExtension when using the native SSL implementation as well to make the usage of it easier and more consistent . These properties were introduced by JDK13 : \n https : / / seanjmullan . org / blog / 2019 / 08 / 05 / jdk13 \n Modifications : \n Check if the properties are set to true and if so enable tickets \n Result : \n Easier to enable tickets and be more consistent
Check if SSL pointer was freed before using it in RefereceCountedOpenSslEngine in all cases ( # 10299 ) \n Motivation : \n To ensure we not crash in all cases we should better check that the SSL pointer was not freed before using it . \n Modifications : \n Add missing ` isDestroyed ( ) ` checks \n Result : \n Ensure we not crash due usage of freed pointer .
Fix memory leak in AbstractDiskHttpData when CompositeByteBuf is used ( # 10360 ) \n Motivation : \n AbstractDiskHttpData may cause a memory leak when a CompositeByteBuf is used . This happened because we may call copy ( ) but actually never release the newly created ByteBuf . \n Modifications : \n - Remove copy ( ) call and just use ByteBuf . getBytes ( . . . ) which will internally handle the writing to the FileChannel without any extra copies that need to be released later on . \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10354
Expand ChannelPipeline javadocs to cover UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor ( # 10361 ) \n Motivation : \n Seems like some users are suprised by the behaviour of DefaultEventExecutor when used within the ChannelPipeline . We should clarify the semantics and also mention UnordedThreadPoolEventExecutor which may be more inline with their expectations \n Modifications : \n Add javadocs section about UnorderedThreadPoolEventExecutor and expand details for DefaultEventExecutor \n Result : \n Clarify sematics
Ensure we feed all data to the SSLEngine during handshaking in our tests ( # 10373 ) \n Motivation : \n Due a bug in our test we may dropped data on the floor which are generated during handshaking ( or slightly after ) . This could lead to corrupt state in the engine itself and so fail tests . This is especially true for TLS1 . 3 which generates the sessions on the server after the " actual handshake " is done . \n Modifications : \n Contine with wrap / unwrap until all data was consumed \n Result : \n Correctly feed all data to the engine during testing
X509TrustManager with OPENSSL provider is not wrapped with hostname verification if Conscrypt is inserted in the first place ( # 10375 ) \n Motivation : \n Modifications : \n Directly specify the provider which is used to create the SSLContext \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10374
Ensure ChannelOptions are applied in the same order as configured in Http2StreamChannelBootstrap ( # 9998 ) ( # 10001 ) \n Motivation : \n https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 9848 changed how we handled ChannelOptions internally to use a ConcurrentHashMap . This unfortunally had the side - effect that the ordering may be affected and not stable anymore . Here the problem is that sometimes we do validation based on two different ChannelOptions ( for example we validate high and low watermarks against each other ) . Thus even if the user specified the options in the same order we may fail to configure them . \n Modifications : \n - Use again a LinkedHashMap to preserve order \n Result : \n Apply ChannelOptions in correct and expected order
Don ' t reuse ChannelPromise in WebSocketProtocolHandler ( # 10248 ) \n Motivation : \n We cant reuse the ChannelPromise as it will cause an error when trying to ful - fill it multiple times . \n Modifications : \n - Use a new promise and chain it with the old one \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10240
Use aarch _ 64 in a consistent way ( # 10845 ) \n Motivation : \n We should use aarch _ 64 in our classifier / jni libname on aarch64 as os . detected . arch uses the name . Being non consistent ( especially across our different projects ) already gave us a lot of trouble in the past . \n Let ' s fix this once for all . \n Modifications : \n Use aarch _ 64 \n Result : \n More consistent classifier usage on aarch64
jdk . tls . client . enableSessionTicketExtension must be respected by OPENSSL and OPENSSL _ REFCNT SslProviders ( # 10401 ) \n Motivation : \n jdk . tls . client . enableSessionTicketExtension property must be respect by OPENSSL and OPENSSL _ REFCNT SslProvider to ensure a consistent behavior . Due a bug this was not the case and it only worked for OPENSSL _ REFCNT but not for OPENSSL . \n Modifications : \n Move the property check into static method that is used by both \n Result : \n Correctly respect jdk . tls . client . enableSessionTicketExtension
Reduce the scope of synchronized block in PoolArena ( # 10410 ) \n Motivation : \n We shouldn ' t call incSmallAllocation ( ) in a synchronized block as its backed by a concurrent datastructure \n Modifications : \n Move call of incSmallAllocation ( ) out of synchronized block \n Result : \n Minimize scope of synchronized block
Update to Blockhound 1 . 0 . 2 ( # 10007 ) \n Motivation : \n A new version of blockhound was released today \n Modifications : \n Upgrade to latest blockhound version \n Result : \n Use latest blockhound release
FixedCompositeByteBuf . isDirect ( ) may return wrong value when constructed with empty array ( # 10005 ) \n Motivation : \n FixedCompositeByteBuf . isDirect ( ) should return the same value as EMPTY _ BUFFER . isDirect ( ) when constructed via an empty array \n Modifications : \n - Return correct value when constructed via empty array . \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n FixedCompositeByteBuf . isDirect ( ) returns correct value
Update netty - build version ( # 10780 ) \n Motivation : \n We recently released a new netty - build version and changed the artifact name \n Modifications : \n Update version and artifact name \n Result : \n Use latest version

Enable SSL _ MODE _ ENABLE _ FALSE _ START if jdkCompatibilityMode is false ( # 10407 ) \n Motivation : \n To reduce latency and RTTs we should use TLS False Start when jdkCompatibilityMode is not required and its supported \n Modifications : \n Use SSL _ MODE _ ENABLE _ FALSE _ START when jdkCompatibilityMode is false \n Result : \n Less RTTs and so lower latency when TLS False Start is supported
Update netty - tcnative to 2 . 0 . 34 . Final ( # 10494 ) \n Motivation : \n A new netty - tcative was released \n Modifications : \n Update to latest version \n Result : \n Use latest version
Don ' t try to remove the task when the underlying executor fails the execution of self ( # 10505 ) \n Motivation : \n It makes no sense to remove the task when the underlying executor fails as we may be able to pick it up later . Beside this the used Queue doesnt support remove ( . . . ) and so will throw . \n Modifications : \n Remove the queue . remove ( . . . ) call \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10501 .
Adjust testsuite to pass on JDK15 + ( # 10511 ) \n Motivation : \n JDK15 is about to be released as GA , we should ensure netty works and builds on it . SSLSession # getPeerCertificateChain ( ) throws UnsupportedOperationException in JDK15 and later as it was deprecated before and people should use SSLSession # getPeerCertificates ( ) . We need to account for that in our tests \n Modifications : \n - Catch UnsupportedOperationException in our testsuite and ignore it when on JDK15 + while rethrowing it otherwise . \n Result : \n Testsuite passes on JDK15 +
Correctly return NEED _ WRAP if we produced some data even if we could not consume any during SSLEngine . wrap ( . . . ) ( # 10396 ) \n Motivation : \n At the moment we may report BUFFER _ OVERFLOW when wrap ( . . . ) fails to consume data but still prodce some . This is not correct and we should better report NEED _ WRAP as we already have produced some data ( for example tickets ) . This way the user will try again without increasing the buffer size which is more correct and may reduce the number of allocations \n Modifications : \n Return NEED _ WRAP when we produced some data but not consumed any . \n Result : \n Fix ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine . wrap ( . . . ) state machine
Fix regression when trying to bind an EpollDatagramChannel with port ( # 10552 ) \n only \n Motivation : \n 4b7dba1 introduced a change which was not 100 % complete and so \n introduce a regression when a user specified to use \n InetProtocolFamily . IPv4 and trying to bind to a port ( without specify \n the ip ) . \n Modifications : \n - Fix regression by respect the InetProtocolFamily \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n Fix regression when binding to port explicit
Make kernel version detection code in EpollReuseAddrTest more robust ( # 10556 ) \n Motivation : \n When we try to parse the kernel version we need to be careful what to \n expect . Especially when a custom kernel is used we may get extra chars \n in the version numbers . For example I had this one fail because of my \n custom kernel that I built for io _ uring : \n 5 . 8 . 7ioring - fixes + \n Modifications : \n - Try to be a bit more lenient when parsing \n - If we cant parse the kernel version just use 0 . 0 . 0 \n Result : \n Tests are more robust
Use special exception when failing because the SSLEngine was closed ( # 10783 ) \n Motivation : \n Sometimes it would be helpful to easily detect if an operation failed due the SSLEngine already be closed . \n Modifications : \n Add special exception that is used when the engine was closed \n Result : \n Easier to detect a failure caused by a closed exception
Only create ConnectTimeoutException if really needed ( # 10595 ) \n Motivation : \n Creating exceptions is expensive so we should only do so if really needed . \n Modifications : \n Only create the ConnectTimeoutException if we really need it . \n Result : \n Less overhead
Increase initial buffer size in AdaptiveRecvByteBufAllocator ( # 10600 ) \n Motivation : \n We should use an initial buffer size with is > = 1500 ( which is a common setting for MTU ) to reduce the need for memory copies when a new connection is established . This is especially interesting when SSL / TLS comes into the mix . \n This was ported from swiftnio : \n https : / / github . com / apple / swift - nio / pull / 1641 \n Modifications : \n Increase the initial size from 1024 to 2048 . \n Result : \n Possible less memory copies on new connections
Filter out duplicates before trying to find the alias to use ( # 10612 ) \n Motivation : \n Calling chooseServerAlias ( . . . ) may be expensive so we should ensure we not call it multiple times for the same auth methods . \n Modifications : \n Remove duplicated from authMethods before trying to call chooseServerAlias ( . . . ) \n Result : \n Less performance overhead during key material selection
Fix SniHandlerTest when jdkCompatibilityMode is false ( # 9934 ) \n Motivation : \n 41c47b4 introduced a change in an existing testcase which let the build fail when jdkCompatibilityMode is false . \n Modifications : \n Fix unit tests \n Result : \n Build passes when jdkCompatibilityMode is false as well
Reduce scope of synchronized block introduced in 5114588cba45179c85b0ce141e10e1e16145af51 ( # 10013 ) \n Motivation : \n We should keep the scope of the synchronized block as small as possible . \n Modifications : \n Reduce scope by copy to an array first before iterate through it \n Result : \n Smaller scope of synchronized
NioEventLoopTest . testChannelsRegistered test failure ( # 10014 ) \n Motivation : \n NioEventLoopTest . testChannelsRegistered sometimes fails due a race which is related to how SelectionKey and Selector is implemented in the JDK . In the current implementation it will " lazy " remove SelectionKeys from the Set which means we may still have these included sometimes when we use size ( ) to get the number of SelectionKeys . \n Modifications : \n Just retry to read the number of registered Channels if we still see 2 \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9895
Fix compilation error on JDK 15 ( # 10462 ) \n Motivation : \n AlgorithmId . sha256WithRSAEncryption _ oid was removed in JDK15 and later so we should not depend on it as otherwise we will see compilation errors \n Modifications : \n Replace AlgorithmId . sha256WithRSAEncryption _ oid usage with specify the OID directly \n Result : \n Compiles on JDK15 +
Fire SniCompletionEvent after onLookupComplete ( . . . ) was called ( # 10688 ) \n Motivation : \n Users may want to do special actions when onComplete ( . . . ) was called and depend on these once they receive the SniCompletionEvent \n Modifications : \n Switch order and so call onLookupComplete ( . . . ) before we fire the event \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10655
Cleanup PoolChunk / PoolSubpage and add a few more asserts ( # 10690 ) \n Motivation : \n As the PooledByteBufAllocator is a critical part of netty we should ensure it works as expected . \n Modifications : \n - Add a few more asserts to ensure we not see any corrupted state \n - Null out slot in the subpage array once the subpage was freed and removed from the pool \n - Merge methods into constructor as it was only called from the constructor anyway . \n Result : \n Code cleanup
Add docker - compose files to compile with OpenJDK15 ( # 10697 ) \n Motivation : \n OpenJDK15 was released , we should compile with it on the CI \n Modifications : \n Add docker - compose files to be able to compile with OpenJDK15 \n Result : \n Compile with latest major JDK version
Add missing - XX : + AllowRedefinitionToAddDeleteMethods for blockhound testsuite ( # 10700 ) \n Motivation : \n We need to also add - XX : + AllowRedefinitionToAddDeleteMethods for JDK15 and 16 as otherwise blockhound will not work \n Modifications : \n Add profiles for JDK15 and JDK16 \n Result : \n Blockhound tests pass again

We did see some leaks reported related to HaProxyMessageEncoderTest on our CI . \n Modifications : \n - Use readSlice ( . . . ) and so not create new ByteBuf instances that need to be released \n Result : \n No more leaks
DatagramDnsResponseDecoder should rethrow as CorruptedFrameException ( # 10714 ) \n Motivation : \n DatagramDnsResponseDecoder should rethrow as CorruptedFrameException if an IndexOutOfBoundsException happens . \n Modifications : \n - Catch IndexOutOfBoundsException and rethrow as CorruptedFrameException \n - Add a testcase \n Result : \n Less noise in the logs
Add NULL checks to fix possible undefined behavior ( # 10718 ) \n Motivation : \n In some situations we could have end up calling some functions with NULL parameters which in this case could lead to undefined behavior . All of this would have happened during loading of the native lib . \n Modifications : \n Add NULL check as guards and return early \n Result : \n Fix some possible undefined behavior
Release message before notify promise ( # 10726 ) \n Motivation : \n We should preferable always release the message before we notify the promise . Thhis has a few advantages : \n - Release memory as soon as possible \n - Listeners observe the " more correct " reference count \n Modifications : \n Release message before fail the promises \n Result : \n Faster releasing of resources . This came up in https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10723
Unregister all native methods on unload for kqueue ( # 10738 ) \n Motivation : \n 03aafb9cff352269a7fc73e4cf0c281770676be9 did ensure we unregister all native methods when we unload / or fail during load of the native library . Unfortunally it missed to unregister in one case for kqueue . \n Modifications : \n Add unregister calls to the unload function \n Result : \n Correctly unregister in all cases
Add PlatformDependent * methods that are needed by io _ uring ( # 10744 ) \n Motivation : \n ddebc10 added a few adjustments that are needed by io _ uring that we will add as an incubator repository . Unfortunally we missed the changed in PlatformDependent * . \n Modifications : \n Add missing methods \n Result : \n Be able to compile io _ uring code against core netty
Rethrow NoSuchMethodError with more hints about incompatible native library versions ( # 10740 ) \n Motivation : \n 03aafb9cff352269a7fc73e4cf0c281770676be9 did ensure we fail while loading a natibe library which is not compatible . While this is great it is still sometimes hard for people to understand what NoSuchMethodError means in this context . \n Modifications : \n If possible rethrow the NoSuchMethodError and provide some more hints about multiple versions of the shared library \n Result : \n Easier to understand for people why loading fails
Errors . throwConnectException ( . . . ) should be public ( # 10745 ) \n Motivation : \n ddebc1027d7cc09850acdd961417c1d650f43dd5 missed to make Errors . throwConnectException ( . . . ) public \n Modifications : \n Make method public \n Result : \n Be able to use Errors . throwConnectException ( . . . ) from other module
Fix NPE in ByteToMessageDecoder if the user removes the handler while channelInputClosed ( . . . ) is processing the buffer . ( # 10817 ) \n Motivation : \n We need to carefully check for null before we pass the cumulation buffer into decodeLast as callDecode ( . . . ) may have removed the codec already and so set cumulation to null . \n Modifications : \n - Check for null and if we see null use Unpooled . EMPTY _ BUFFEr \n - Only call decodeLast ( . . . ) if callDecode ( . . . ) didnt remove the handler yet . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10802
OpenSsl . memoryAddress ( . . . ) should use internalNioBuffer ( . . . ) if it can ' t access the memoryAddress ( # 10818 ) \n Motivation : \n We can make use of internalNioBuffer ( . . . ) if we cant access the memoryAddress . This at least will reduce the object creations . \n Modifications : \n Use internalNioBuffer ( . . . ) and so reduce the GC \n Result : \n Less object creation if we can ' t access the memory address .
Update Java versions ( # 10273 ) \n Motivation : \n We should use the latest patch release of each java version \n Modifications : \n Update versions \n Result : \n Use latest versions on CI

Ensure IovArray is usuable without sun . misc . Unsafe ( # 10870 ) \n Motivation : \n https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 10814 did fix a bug where we did try to call memoryAddress ( ) even tho this is not supported . Unfortunally this fix was only applied for one method and so we missed another method which then could throw an exception when we called memoryAddress ( ) \n Modifications : \n - Also fix the memoryAddress ( offset ) method . \n _ Adjust unit test to also test this . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10813 completely .
Add fallback for android when trying to access the filedescriptor via JNI ( # 10882 ) \n Motivation : \n Android seems to use a different field name so we should also try to access it with the name used by android . \n Modifications : \n Try first fd and if this fails try descriptor as field name \n Result : \n Workaround for android .
Use correct docker - compose file to deploy cross compiled artifacts
Use correct docker - compose task to deploy for cross compiled artifacts
Only deploy snapshots for one arch \n Motivation : \n We need to find a way to deploy SNAPSHOTS for different arch with the same timestamp . Otherwise it will cause problems . \n See https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 10887 \n Modification : \n Skip all other deploys then x86 _ 64 \n Result : \n Users are able to use SNAPSHOTS for x86 _ 6
Use maven cachen when running analyze job ( # 10888 ) \n Motivation : \n To prevent failures to problems while downloading dependencies we shoud cache these \n Modifications : \n Add maven cache \n Result : \n No more failures due problems while downloading dependencies
Dont use cron for PRs \n Motivation : \n It doesnt make sense to use cron for PRs \n Modifications : \n Remove cron config \n Result : \n Cleanup
We run all combinations when validate the PR , let ' s just use one type for normal push \n Motivation : \n Let us just only use one build config when building the 4 . 1 branch . \n Modifications : \n As we already do a full validation when doing the PR builds we can just only use one build config for pushes to the " main " branches \n Result : \n Faster build times
Update README \n Motivation : \n We can add some status badge and also should clarify requirements . \n Modifictations : \n - Add status badge \n - Clarify requirements \n Result : \n Cleanup docs

Let script fail if one command fail ( # 10945 ) \n Motivation : \n We should use ` set - e ` to ensure we fail the script if one command fails . \n Modifications : \n Add set - e to script \n Result : \n Fail fast
Use GracefulShutdown when stream space is exhausted ( # 10946 ) \n Motivation : \n We should use GracefulShutdown when we try to create a stream and fail it because the stream space is exhausted as we may still want to process the active streams . \n Modifications : \n - Use graceful shutdown \n - Add unit test \n Result : \n More graceful handling of stream creation failure due stream space exhaustation
Make native loading logging less confusing ( # 10944 ) \n Motivation : \n We produced a lot of noise during loading native libraries as we always included the stacktrace if we could not load by one mechanism . We should better just not include the stacktrace in the debugging logging if one mechanism fails . We will log all the stacks anyway when all of the mechanisms fail . \n Modifications : \n Make logging less aggressive \n Result : \n Less confusing behaviour for the end - user
Override ALPN methods on ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine ( # 10954 ) \n Motivation : \n We should override the get * ApplicationProtocol ( ) methods in ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine to make it easier for users to obtain the selected application protocol \n Modifications : \n Add missing overrides \n Result : \n Easier for the user to get the selected application protocol ( if any )
Use action to report unit test errors ( # 10966 ) \n Motivation : \n To make it easier to understand why the build fails lets use an action that will report which unit test failed \n Modifications : \n - Replace custom script with action - surefire - report \n Result : \n Easier to understand test failures
Update dependency declaration in all pom . xml ( # 10967 ) \n Motivation : \n We did have the architecture hardcoded in the dependency which is not correct as this will let the build fail on Applie Silicion ( m1 ) . Also we did miss some dependencies on other BSDs \n Modifications : \n - Fix classifier \n - Add missing dependencies \n Result : \n Be able to build on Apple Silicon ( m1 )
Use custom script to check for build failures ( # 10968 ) \n Motivation : \n It turns out we can ' t use the action to check for build failures as it can ' t be used when a PR is done from a fork . Let ' s just use our simple script . \n Modifications : \n - Replace action with custom script \n Result : \n Builds for PRs that are done via forks work again .
Ignore SocketShutdownOutputBySelfTest . testWriteAfterShutdownOutputNoWritabilityChange ( # 10970 ) \n Motivation : \n The testWriteAfterShutdownOutputNoWritabilityChange ( ) failed a few times on the CI randomly . Let ' s skip it for now while we investigate and see if there is anything we can do to make the test less flaky on the CI . \n Modifications : \n Add @ Ignore on the testWriteAfterShutdownOutputNoWritabilityChange method \n Result : \n Less flaky CI
Fix possible SEGV when using native dns resolver on macos ( # 10971 ) \n Motivation : \n We should add some more NULL checks to ensure we not SEGV in some cases \n Modifications : \n Add more NULL checks \n Result : \n More robust implementation
Revert " Enable SSL _ MODE _ ENABLE _ FALSE _ START if jdkCompatibilityMode is false ( # 10407 ) " ( # 10980 ) \n Motivation : \n TLS _ FALSE _ START slightly changes the " flow " during handshake which may cause suprises for the end - user . We should better disable it by default again and later add a way to enable it for the user . \n Modification : \n This reverts commit 514d349e1fa5a057e815a5f3ac6a7e3f3aa19784 . \n Result : \n Restore " old flow " during TLS handshakes .
Fail the the finish _ release . sh script if the tag already exists locally \n Motivation : \n We should fail the script if the tag already exists locally to ensure we really deploy the right code \n Modifications : \n Check if the tag already exists and if so print an error and exit \n Result : \n No risks to deploy wrong code as part of the release
Close and release the staging repository at the end \n Motivation : \n We can just close and release the staging repository at the end and so remove the extra manual steps \n Modification : \n Execute extra goals for close and release \n Result : \n Less manual actions needed for release
Add script which list staged releases \n Motivation : \n When finish the release process we need to give the id of the staged release . Let ' s add a script for that \n Modifications : \n Add script which allows to show all staged releases \n Result : \n No need to login into sonatype anymore
Update timeout to 10 minutes \n Motivation : \n We should use a higher timeout as sometimes the verification process in oss . sonatype . org is very slow . \n Modifications : \n Bump up timeout to 10 minutes \n Result : \n Less likely to see timeouts
Publish test results after PR run ( # 11002 ) \n Motivation : \n To make it easier to understand why a build failed let us publish the rest results \n Modifications : \n Use a new workflow to be able to publish the test reports \n Result : \n Easier to understand why a PR did fail
Update to latest os - maven - plugin ( # 11003 ) \n Motivation : \n A new version of the os - maven - plugin was released \n Modifications : \n Update to latest version \n Result : \n Use latest version

Add ability to customize class used to detect tests ( # 1654 ) \n Developers should not ship JUnit in their app , even in debug . However , some debug libraries unfortunately ship with JUnit as a dependency ( e . g . see https : / / github . com / square / okhttp / issues / 4667 ) . \n Developers can change the default to target a different class ( e . g assertj ) to help LeakCanary detect unit tests , by overriding a public string : \n ` ` ` \n < string name = " leak _ canary _ test _ class _ name " > org . assertj . core . api . Assertions < / string > \n ` ` ` \n Fixes # 1649

Pending analysis won ' t block heap dumps anymore ( # 1315 ) \n Previously , we looked for a ` * _ pending . hprof ` file younger than 10 minutes on the filesystem to detect if an analysis was in progress , and skip heap dumps to avoid constantly doing heap dumps . \n This meant that if the process died ( e . g . crash ) during an analysis , no heap dumps would happen in the next 10 minutes . \n Heap analysis is now fast , it finds many leaks at once , it ' s serial and in a single process . This means we can remove this behavior and just dump the heap whenever thresholds are met and then enqueue work to the serial service . \n If the process is killed during an analysis , it won ' t resume but it ' s easy enough to import the hprof again , from the sd card . \n Fixes # 1312
Adding ( ignored ) profiled test ( # 1563 )
Don ' t crash when LeakSentry is not installed ( # 1349 ) \n LeakSentry may not always be installed , e . g . if there ' s another process that ' s not the main process . Default behavior should be a no - op rather than crashing . \n Fixes # 1345

Backward compatibility with Okio 1 . x ( # 1677 ) \n LeakCanary was using APIs introduced in Okio 2 . x ( extension functions ) , which breaks any consumers that forces Okio to 1 . x . This change reverts to using the 1 . x APIs . Unfortunately we cannot directly compile against 2 . x because the deprecated APIs have an Error deprecation level . So here the module that depends on Okio compiles against 1 . x , and then its consumer module depends on 2 . x so that the resolution defaults to the higher version . This has the advantage of enforcing that we write code that compiles against two versions of Okio \n Fixes # 1624

According to [ this github comment ] ( https : / / github . com / react - native - community / datetimepicker / issues / 285 ) it works well . \n This will fix DatePicker for both Fabric and Paper , since Fabric uses the interop layer to render it . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : fkgozali \n Differential Revision : D23935328 \n fbshipit - source - id : 1a7fadba274e0537f0ac4ced60e23e7c809d57dc

Fix duplicate Networking module bug \n Summary : \n While investigating a bridgeless networking issue , I noticed something very peculiar . * * Two * * networking turbo modules are built and used in bridgeless mode . Upon debugging , I realized that each of them have a different ` TurboModuleHolder ` . The reason is the following : \n 1 . In JS , the module ' s name is [ Networking ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / f2xu4wie ) \n 2 . In ObjC , we call the module " RCTNetworking " ( examples in this diff ) \n 3 . Both scenarios end up creating the correct Turbo Module : [ RCTNetworking ] ( https : / / www . internalfb . com / intern / diffusion / FBS / browsefile / master / xplat / js / react - native - github / Libraries / Network / RCTNetworking . mm ? link _ ref = search ) , but the ` TurboModuleHolder ` doesn ' t know that " RCTNetworking " and " Networking " are the same . Any other modules accessed this way will have the same issue . \n An alternative solution would be to tell ` TurboModuleHolder ` to strip the ` RCT ` suffix , which would solve the problem globally .

Handle action bar being null \n It ' s ok , if there ' s no action bar , we can still press back . \n Fixes # 967
Make installed RefWatcher a singleton \n - This change is needed for the incoming work on detecting leaks in instrumentation tests . \n - This changes the semantic meaning of " install " from " add an activity watcher " to " keep a reference to the ref watcher and maybe add an activity watcher " . \n - As a result , we introduce AndroidRefWatcherBuilder # watchActivity ( defaults true ) so that an instance can be installed without watching activities . \n - This also means user code will not need to keep the installed ref watcher instance around on their own ( they can , especially for injection , but don ' t have to anymore )

Update to support - core - utils 26 . 0 . 0 \n We don ' t need the latest version of the support library ( there are no bugs that impact what \n LeakCanary relies on ) , we ' re sticking a bit older because most apps will be using a more \n recent version and they ' ll automatically resolve to higher version without having to \n necessarily resort to a resolution strategy . This is also the version we use in \n leakcanary - support - fragment . \n Fixes # 986
Undo binary incompatible change \n In # 1010 we introduced a binary incompatible change by moving ActivityRefWatcher to an internal package and removing method . This change undoes that , while also marking the class as deprecated from an API standpoint .

Work around null KeyedWeakReference . key \n - Make HahaHelper . asString ( ) explicitly non nullable instead of crashing later with NPE \n - If KeyedWeakReference . key is null ( which should never happen at runtime ) , then we skip and keep looking for keys , but report all the null keys if we couldn ' t find any . \n If this was caused by some malformed object then we have a chance of actually finding the right KeyedWeakReference instance . However , if this was caused by a heap dump parsing issue then we ' ll \n still crash but at least we ' ll have an exception closer to the source . \n Fixes # 874
Add LeakCanary . installedRefWatcher ( ) to no - op \n Also changing the default behavior to disabled ( rather than throwing ) . \n Fixes # 1058

Prevent Jetifier from changing classname strings \n LeakCanary supports both Android X and the support library .

Don ' t look for activity in application \n In this [ StackOverflow question ] ( https : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 62213443 / finding - cause - in - leakcanary - leak - trace ) I noticed this bit : \n ` ` ` \n D LeakCanary : ├─ < > . application . HomeApplication \n D LeakCanary : │ Leaking : NO ( Application is a singleton ) \n D LeakCanary : │ HomeApplication does not wrap an activity context \n ` ` ` \n The comment ` HomeApplication does not wrap an activity context ` doesn ' t make sense for an application , it ' s meant for ContextWrapper instances that may wrap an activity context . \n This fixes that , and optimizes things a bit so that we don ' t keep looking up the full class hierarchy .

Rename the ` guard ` utility to ` tryParse ` \n Summary : \n # # What is ` guard ` ? \n ` guard ` accepts some JavaScript function that can throw a ParserError . If a ParserError is thrown by that JavaScript function , it captures and pushes the error to some global array , and returns null .

In the NativeModule spec linter , we want to display all these ParserErrors via ESLint . \n # # Changes \n This diff renames ` guard ` to ` tryParse ` because ` tryParse ` more appropriately captures the intent / function of this utility : the work passed to it " tries " to parse some Flow types .

Introduce RCTModuleRegistry \n Summary : \n # # Problem \n Many of our NativeModules are TurboModule - compatible . All our TurboModules currently use the bridge to require other NativeModules / TurboModules . As we migrate more surfaces to Venice , this lookup in many of these TurboModules will break , because the bridge will be nil . \n # # Initial Solution \n We migrate all these TurboModules over to the turboModuleRegistry . In FBiOS , this will work because all NativeModules are TurboModule - compatible , and should [ have the turboModuleRegistry attached to them by the TurboModuleManager ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / d747fbc3 ) . However , this solution has a few problems : \n - If the TurboModule is used within a TurboModule - disabled app , it will break , because turboModuleRegistry will be nil on the module . Therefore , this solution isn ' t portable / flexible across apps . \n - Longer term , we should deprecate synthesize bridge inside NativeModules . With this approach , we can ' t remove the synthesize bridge = bridge call from the NativeModule . \n # # Suggested Solution \n Both NativeModules and TurboModules will be given access to an ` RCTModuleRegistry ` object . The RCTModuleRegistry object will use the TurboModuleManager when available and the Bridge when available to query for NativeModules and TurboModules . Otherwise , it ' ll just return nil . \n When we do a lookup via this RCTModuleRegistry : \n - In Venice , the bridge will be nil , so we won ' t search the bridge . \n - In FBiOS , the bridge and the TurboModuleManager will be non - nil , so we ' ll first search the bridge , and then the TurboModuleManager . \n - In standalone apps , the TurboModuleManager will be nil , so we ' ll only do a lookup on the bridge . \n Long story short , RCTModuleRegistry will do the right thing in all scenarios . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : PeteTheHeat \n Differential Revision : D25412847 \n fbshipit - source - id : 13f41276158d90c68ab4925e518d71a2f369c210

Hence : \n ` ` ` \n type SchemaType = { \n modules : { \n [ moduleName ] : ComponentSchema | NativeModuleSchema \n } \n } ; \n ` ` ` \n The ` ComponentSchema ` can contain specifications for many different components . Hence : \n ` ` ` \n type ComponentSchema = { \n type : ' Component ' \n components : { \n [ componentName ] : ComponentShape \n } \n } \n ` ` ` \n The ` NativeModuleSchema ` contains \n 1 .

Potentially many different NativeModule requires ( for now ) via ` TurboModuleRegistry . get ( Enforcing ) ? < specName > ( ' moduleName ' ) ` . \n Hence , the shape looks like : \n ` ` ` \n type NativeModuleSchema = { \n type : ' NativeModule ' , \n aliases : NativeModuleAliasMap , / / nothing new \n spec : NativeModuleSpec , \n moduleNames : $ ReadOnlyArray < string > \n } \n type NativeModuleSpec = { \n properties : $ ReadOnlyArray < . . . > , \n } \n ` ` ` \n # # Major Notes \n 1 .

Roll out TurboModule block copy \n Summary : \n # # Description \n During TurboModule method invocation , when we convert JavaScript callbacks ( i . e : jsi : : Functions ) into ObjC blocks inside the TurboModule jsi : : HostObject , we [ push them into an array ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / r1n75ikx ) that [ gets cleared after the method gets invoked ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / ubbvdmfs ) . \n Prior to this experiment , we pushed these ObjC blocks into the array without copying them first . This goes contrary to ObjC best practices , which suggest that if you need to retain a block past its creation context for later invocation , you should defensively copy it to prevent it from being freed early . See the [ Apple docs ] ( https : / / developer . apple . com / library / archive / documentation / Cocoa / Conceptual / Blocks / Articles / bxUsing . html # / / apple _ ref / doc / uid / TP40007502 - CH5 - SW1 ) : \n > Typically , you shouldn’t need to copy ( or retain ) a block . You only need to make a copy when you expect the block to be used after destruction of the scope within which it was declared . Copying moves a block to the heap . \n The diff that introduced the fix : D23764329 ( https : / / github . com / facebook / react - native / commit / 9b76e217bb16935069f0ea5b60f4c4d9b73f86d6 ) . \n Reviewed By : PeteTheHeat \n Differential Revision : D25617672 \n fbshipit - source - id : 24863b31a2d82c8d39a91c8ea8eb3a62724b800a
Roll out package info validation \n Summary : \n # # Context \n Every time we require a NativeModule in Java , we [ first try to create it with the TurboModuleManager ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / 3nkjwea2 ) . In the TurboModule infra , when a NativeModule is requested , [ we first create it ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / d2c6iout ) , then [ if it ' s not a TurboModule , we discard the newly created object ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / 44gjlo6y ) . This is extremely wasteful , especially when a NativeModule is requested frequently and periodically , like UIManagerModule . \n Therefore , in D24811838 ( https : / / github . com / facebook / react - native / commit / 803a26cb003e6b790e3a1ab31beb0c95795fff0c ) fkgozali launched a fix to the infra that would avoid creating the non - TurboModule object in the first place .

Default initialize RCTNetworking with observation disabled \n Summary : \n # # Context \n When you add / remove listeners from event emitters in JavaScript on iOS , we [ call the NativeModule ' s addListener / removeListener methods ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / 4878jv6p ) . These addListener ( ) and removeListener ( ) methods [ are implemented on the RCTEventEmitter class ] ( https : / / fburl . com / diffusion / y913pqhy ) .

Add ConnectivityManager . TYPE _ PROXY to SystemApi \n This follows other TYPE _ * constants like TYPE _ WIFI _ P2P that are \n @ SystemApi or public . \n TYPE _ PROXY has a use - case for the system to set network policies based \n on proxy network templates . Although network types are deprecated , that \n use - case needs to be supported and significant amounts of network \n management would need to be rewritten to stop using network types . \n The constant needs to be API as ConnectivityManager is planned to move \n out of framework . jar , so only its formal API will be available to the \n system server . \n Bug : 174436414 \n Test : m \n Change - Id : I266ed6bc59f5eb72302afe14472c93933733c8f8
Add OWNERS for packages / Connectivity \n In preparation of future modularization of connectivity classes , a large \n part of frameworks / base / services / net is planned to be moved to \n packages / modules / Connectivity . However moving each class " manually " \n to that git project would lose their commit history , and require many \n cross - repository topics . \n To facilitate the work , create frameworks / base / packages / Connectivity , \n which will be used to move the classes at first , before they can all be \n moved together with their history to packages / modules / Connectivity .

Do not depend on Tethering stubs in CM consts \n Tethering API stubs depend on connectivity stubs for classes like \n MacAddress or LinkAddress , so connectivity stubs cannot depend on \n Tethering stubs or there would be a circular dependency . \n This means ConnectivityManager API surface cannot reference Tethering \n API constants . Instead , use the literal in ConnectivityManager . \n This means that both ConnectivityManager and TetheringManager specify \n the constant value . An alternative considered was to have \n TetheringManager depend on the ConnectivityManager constants , but \n considering that ConnectivityManager only has some of the constants , \n this would be more confusing . Breaking the constants by mistake is \n unlikely as their values are part of the API surface , so will always be \n in sync . \n Bug : 171540887 \n Test : m \n Change - Id : I16b6e1912fffc5ff8b3b392901d2357ffd213c72

Switch TextInput to useLayoutEffect \n Summary : \n This diff fixes an issue in ` TextInput ` where ` TextInputState . currentlyFocusedInputRef ` could maintain a ref to a view that no longer exists . This issue was exposed when upgrading React , where cleanups for passive effects are deferred . This change means that ` inputRef . current ` would no longer reference the host view * to be * destroyed ; it would be null because the view was * already destroyed * . \n There are two fixes here that would independently fix the bug and fix the issue better together . \n First , we convert ` useEffect ` to ` useLayoutEffect ` . ` useLayoutEffect ` is intended to fire synchronously after all host view mutations , and the cleanup function is intended to fire synchronously before the host view is destroyed , similar to the behavior assumed before . This change is now the correct function to use semantically . However , if we made this change without the second then any change in the order the effects fire would surface the same bug . \n So second , move the ` inputRefValue ) . blur ( ) ` call to the same effect as unregistering . This is because we currently require the ` blur ` effect to be called to null out ` currentlyFocusedInputRef ` in addition to calling ` unregisterInput ` . That makes the semantic ordering of effects in ` TextInput ` meaningful . Instead , when a TextInput is unregistered we should always ` blur ` to clear the ` currentlyFocusedInputRef ` , which will prevent dispatching events to a view that doesn ' t exist . If we made this change without the first then there ' s would be a race condition between calling blur on a TextInput and when that TextInput has been unregistered . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : JoshuaGross \n Differential Revision : D23035358 \n fbshipit - source - id : ab686b8046d85e2becd8b879b0b4b7e69e672754
Change the memory warning forced GC to use the level name \n Summary : \n We ' re seeing that GCs caused by memory warnings on Android are barely collecting \n any memory and are operating on much smaller heaps than natural GCs . \n This is likely due to some of the TRIM _ MEMORY _ * events firing too often . \n Log which event name it was , instead of the generic " memory warning " , to narrow \n down the cases where the memory warning was helpful . Unhelpful warnings will \n later be moved to not force a GC . \n Note that this diff changes Venice , but we don ' t see any Venice heaps in production , \n so it won ' t matter much other than making the code match up . \n Also note that iOS has a similar memory warning in ` RCTCxxBridge . mm ` , but it hasn ' t \n been called in production .

Remove producible request attribute before mapping \n The attribute was previously removed only before exception resolution \n in the DispatcherServlet in order to allow error rendering to make an \n independent choice on content negotation . \n However , Boot rendering happens later in an ERROR dispatch which could \n also be a nested dispatch on some servers . So the attribute must also \n generally be removed prior to mapping . \n We also move the methods where this is done to the base \n RequestMappingInfoHandlerMapping class which also deals with the \n produces condition and where the producible attribute is added in the \n first place . \n Closes gh - 24466

Ensure FileAppenderFactoryTest works within its temporary directories ( # 3692 ) \n * Ensure FileAppenderFactoryTest works within its temporary directories \n Ensure these tests use the temporary directory provided by JUnit for their log \n files . \n Stop the appender before finishing the test so that open file handles won ' t \n upset Windows . \n * Do some small cleanups to dropwizard - logging FileAppenderFactoryTest \n Remove unnecessary exception declarations and switch to using \n assertThatExceptionOfType
Replace Streams usage with String # join ( # 3646 ) \n We can use ` String . join ( ) ` in a couple of places to replace usage of the Streams API .
Remove legacy xpack extension permissions ( # 64743 ) \n The first implement of xpack extensions implemented them completely \n within xpack . In order to support extensions adding additional \n permissions to those used by xpack , the extension mechanism needed broad \n policy permissions . However , since then xpack extension apis were moved \n to SPI and can now be done as any other plugin . This commit removes the \n permissions that are no longer used from the xpack security policy .
Fix incorrect setContextClassLoader permissions ( # 64745 ) \n Netty requires the setContextClassLoader permission . However , many of \n our policy files incorrectly use ` * ` as the name , thinking \n ` setContextClassLoader ` is the actions element of the permission ( it \n looks like a copy paste error that was then itself copy pasted through \n several policy files ) . This commit corrects these permissions , which had \n actually granted all RuntimePermissions .
Remove unnecessary classloader permissions in xpack ( # 64750 ) \n Xpack core contains a utility class for setting and restoring the \n context class loader when entering certain libraries which depend on the \n context classloader . The permissions for getting and setting the \n classloader are only needed within this core class , \n RestorableContextClassLoader , yet thes permissions ( along with the \n comment ) have been copied to a few other security policy files . This \n commit removes those unnecessary permissions from modules outside of \n xpack core .
Remove provider permissions from ingest - attachment plugin ( # 64814 ) \n At some point the the past , PDFBox setup the bouncycastle security \n provider explicitly . However , since then it looks like they have moved \n away from that and no longer force that provider \n ( https : / / issues . apache . org / jira / browse / PDFBOX - 2963 ) , which means we no \n longer need to grant those security provider permissions . This commit \n removes these legacy permissions .
Upgrade bundled jdk to 15 . 0 . 1 and switch back to Oracle ( # 64253 ) \n This commit updates the bundled jdk to 15 . 0 . 1 , and at the same time once \n again switches the bundled jdk back to adoptopenjdk , which has fixed \n their build problem and regained support for glibc 2 . 12 . \n closes # 64026
Use different security policies for eclipse vs intellij ( # 65234 ) \n Intellij has a special junit runner jar that needs additional security \n manager permissions . However , this jar is not present in eclipse . This \n commit adds a new ( empty ) policy for eclipse , and then chooses which to \n load based on the presence of the special intellij junit jar . This is a \n bit of a hack , but there are no special system properties for intellij \n or eclipse that I could find ( there are substrings that could be \n searched for in existing properties , but looking for a specific key is \n much easier to do that searching a substring ) . \n relates # 65231
Move security manager codebases files to plugin - metadata ( # 65243 ) \n The codebases files are hints that allow the test framework to map \n codebase names required by plugin security policy files to urls that may \n exist as classes directories on disk . These files end up in the same \n test resources directory in gradle , but in eclipse they exist in \n different directories . This commit reorganizes the files so they exist \n within the same plugin - metadata source , thereby existing in the same \n output directory used by tests . Finally , the codebases files are \n filtered out of the final jar within the plugin build .
Add codebases hints for testing ( # 65281 ) \n This commit adds codebases files for the remaining plugin security \n policies that use jar specific grants .

Assert preconditions for MergedAnnotations . from ( ) factory methods \n Prior to this commit , if null values were supplied for the \n RepeatableContainers or AnnotationFilter arguments to ` from ( ) ` factory \n methods in MergedAnnotations , certain operations would eventually \n result in a NullPointerException . This is to be expected ; however , the \n NullPointerException is often swallowed and only logged at INFO level \n with an exception message similar to the following . \n > Failed to introspect annotations on org . example . MyClass : NullPointerException \n In such cases , the INFO log message is not helpful in diagnosing the \n problem . Furthermore , since the exception is swallowed , the desired \n operation ( e . g . , MergedAnnotations . stream ( . . . ) ) simply returns no \n results . \n This commit improves the user experience by eagerly asserting non - null \n preconditions for required arguments in MergedAnnotations . from ( ) \n factory methods . \n Closes gh - 25568

In other words , " test " is always a substring of \n " org . springframework . test . . . " , which is not a meaningful assertion . \n This commit ensures that the JUnit Platform Test Kit is asserting the \n actual names of test methods .

Ignore null Locale in MockHttpServletResponse \n Prior to this commit , calls to setLocale ( ) MockHttpServletResponse \n would result in a NullPointerException if the supplied Locale was null . \n Although the Javadoc for setLocale ( Locale ) and addHeader ( String , String ) \n in javax . servlet . ServletResponse does not specify how a null \n Locale should be handled , both Tomcat and Jetty simply ignore a null \n value . \n This commit therefore updates MockHttpServletResponse to silently \n ignore a null Locale passed to setLocale ( ) . \n Closes gh - 26493

Support load - time weaving for @ Component classes again \n Since Spring Framework 5 . 2 , the LoadTimeWeaver no longer weaves bean \n classes annotated with @ Component . This is a regression caused by the \n changes in 40c62139ae , stemming from the fact that any class annotated \n or meta - annotated with @ Component is considered to be a candidate \n configuration class in ' configuration lite ' mode ( i . e . , a class without \n the @ Configuration annotation and without any @ Bean methods ) and \n therefore now has its class eagerly loaded . This results in the class \n being loaded before the LoadTimeWeaver has a chance to weave it . \n This commit fixes this regression by explicitly avoiding eager class \n loading for any ' lite ' @ Configuration or @ Component class without @ Bean \n methods . \n Closes gh - 26199

Remove obsolete commandName attribute in spring - form . tld \n Since support for the commandName attribute was removed from the \n implementation of FormTag in Spring Framework 5 . 0 , the presence of the \n commandName attribute in the spring - form . tld file is no longer valid \n and can lead one to assume that the commandName attribute is still \n supported - - for example when using code completion in a JSP editor . \n This commit therefore removes the obsolete commandName attribute in \n spring - form . tld . \n Closes gh - 26337

Avoid race where Request snapshot contains null . \n Our implementation of toArray ( ) called size ( ) \n multiple times , starting with the size used for \n the array . size ( ) in WeakHashMap removes entries \n from the map if the corresponding WeakReference \n has been cleared . As a result , if a reference \n was added to WeakHashMap ' s reference queue between \n our outer call to size ( ) and the methods in \n toArray ( ) , the actual number of entries might have \n been smaller than our array size , which would \n lead to one or more null entries at the end of the \n Snapshot array . \n Fixes # 322 .

Avoid removing jobs from queues to ensure cleanup runs . \n Right now we’re overly aggressive about removing jobs that may have pending data from queues on executors .

Close HttpUrlConnections when following redirects in HttpUrlFetcher . \n Progress towards # 2352 .
Always set stream when connecting HttpUrlConnection \n That way we will always close the stream in cleanup ( ) . Prior to this change , when cancel was called , stream was never set to non - null and therefore never closed in cleanup . Because disconnecting the stream doesn’t seem to close the contained ResponseBody object , failing to obtain and then close the stream results in leaked objects . \n Progress towards # 2352
Key off of the safe key in writeLock in DiskLruCacheWrapper . \n The Key we’re given may have a different implementation for equals and hashCode than it does for updateDiskCacheKey . As a result , two different \n Key objects that are not equal to each other may produce the same \n disk cache key . To avoid simultaneous puts for the same disk cache key \n we need to lock on the disk cache key , not the original key object .
Avoid including default source sets in repackaged compiler jar . \n Unless you override the jar task completely , any files you specified are \n added to the original files , not replaced . To make matters worse , gradle \n does not fail jar tasks when duplicate classes are added by default . \n We’ve fixed the immediate issue with compiler’s jar file by excluding classes that do not originate from our repackaged / proguarded jar to \n avoid duplicate class files . We’ve hopefully also prevented future occurrences by forcing all jar tasks in the project to fail by default \n if duplicate classes are added . \n Fixes # 2452 .

Fix GifDrawable restart after stop emulator test .
Fix a couple of errors related to registersComponents refactor .
Avoid setting the Accept - Encoding header to identify by default . \n The Accept - Encoding header was added to ensure that we receive content \n length headers in responses . The Performance section of \n HttpUrlConnection’s documentation https : / / goo . gl / o2jeUM ) indicates that \n unless Accept - Encoding is set to ‘identity’ , the content length of the \n response will be cleared . In practice this appears to be incorrect for \n all API levels that Glide v4 supports ( 14 + ) and content length is \n always populated . \n Passing in ‘identity’ as the encoding header is problematic because \n it disables the default compression in HttpUrlConnection and some \n servers disregard the header and provide compressed data anyway . There’s \n not much point in adding extra complexity to Glide to handle compressed \n data if the ‘identity’ header isn’t actually required to get valid \n content lengths for images . \n Fixes # 2132 .
Fix a typo in maven dependency in README . md
Avoid using isLaidOut in ViewTarget . \n Fixes # 1981 .

Clean up DataFetchers even if DecodeJobs are cancelled prior to run ( ) . \n Previously some of the logic in run ( ) might null out the data fetcher \n instance variable , even if it had been set when run ( ) was first called . \n As a result , the data fetcher would not be cleared . Now the initial \n data fetcher is held on to as a local variable so the instance variable \n can be freed without affecting the behavior of cleanup ( ) . \n Progress towards # 1996 , # 2352
Return true from isDone in RequestFutureTarget if load has failed . \n Fixes # 1063 .

Rewind ByteBuffers in ByteBufferUtil . toFile . \n This avoids writing partial data if the buffer is not at position 0 when the method is called . This fixes a bug where using DiskCacheStrategy . ALL \n or DiskCacheStrategy . RESOURCE with GifDrawables would result in partial \n and invalid gif files being written to Glide’s disk cache .
Avoid double logging GlideException errors . \n Fixes # 2266 .
Set defaultRequestOptions to the return value of apply in GlideBuilder . \n apply may return new object if autoClone ( ) is enabled on a \n RequestOptions object that is passed into the builder via setDefaultRequestOptions .
Call clone ( ) before calling extension methods if auto clone is enabled . \n Otherwise when our extension methods mutate the RequestOptions we pass \n them , the mutations create a new RequestOptions object that’s dropped \n at the end of the extension method , which causes any options applied in \n the extension method to be ignored . Cloning first matches the behavior \n of other RequestOptions methods and ensures that the RequestOptions \n object passed into the extension method is mutable .

Update annotation compiler deps to avoid unnecessary pom dependencies .
Avoid varargs warnings using @ SafeVarags in generated code . \n The annotation can only be added to final methods , so we have to use \n @ SuppessWarnings for RequestOptions instead . As a result callers of \n transforms ( ) will have to suppress the warning on their end as well . \n Fixes # 2383 .
Explicitly add Cloneable interface to GlideOptions and GlideRequests . \n It seems like this shouldn’t be necessary , but it fixes a PMD warning . \n Fixes # 2394 .

Allow modifying RequestBuilders after calling into ( ) . \n Fixes an issue where setting options on the generated GlideRequest after \n having used it to load one image would throw an exception because the \n internal RequestOptions object was locked when the first load was \n started . Now we apply autoClone ( ) to make sure that the options object \n for the first load isn’t modified by subsequent changes to options , but \n also allowing those changes to occur .
Use Math . random ( ) instead of UUID to create GIF frame signatures . \n Fixes # 1510 .

Add an explicit null check to Util . getSnapshot . \n Explicitly checking for null avoids our previous implicit expectation \n that the iterator of the provided Collection would do the null checking \n for us . This expectation is valid in Glide right now because we only \n pass WeakHashMaps to this method , but it seems like a dangerous \n assumption to make in a utility method . \n We can’t require a WeakHashMap directly because all of our usages are \n wrapped in Collections . newSetFromMap .

Stop GifDrawable in onFrameReady if all callbacks are Drawables . \n When we use TransitionDrawable , the GifDrawable’s callback is always \n non - null and always the TransitionDrawable , even if the \n TransitionDrawable was removed from the view hierarchy .

Return true from RequestTracker . clearRemoveAndRecycle for null Requests . \n If the request is null , we don’t need to do anything to clear it , so \n we might as well treat the clear as successful . Doing so also matches \n the behavior in RequestManager when we have a non - null Target with \n a null Request .
Consistently use timeouts in CachingTest . \n None of these waits are flaky , but if we do break a test in a way that \n prevents a callback we expect , the test will time out instead of hanging \n forever .

Catch NPEs and RuntimeExceptions thrown in getActiveNetworkInfo . \n The framework seems to throw these on various devices and versions of \n Android , though mostly on Samsung between APIs 22 and 24 . \n The deleted test was passing because of an exception in isConnected , not \n in registerReceiver so it was incorrect . There doesn’t seem to be a way \n to force Robolectric to throw when registering receivers .
Default test coverage disabled . \n It breaks the debugger for emulator tests and we don’t actually need it \n on .

Set device to Nexus 4 and re - enable API 16 , 17 , and 18 emulator tests . \n Fixes # 2738 .
Mark a couple of non - null methods in Registry as NonNull instead of Nullable . \n I missed these the first time around , but they throw exceptions if the \n result is null , so they either return a non - null value or throw , which \n qualifies as NonNull .
Remove jacoco / coveralls integration . \n It hasn’t worked in at least 6 + months .
Switch back to the travis container based build system .
Fix an NPE in ResourceDrawableDecoder . \n The NPE would only occur if the load was going to fail for the decoder \n anyway , but at least this way we don’t show a scary looking NPE for \n an expected case .
Add the violations - gradle - plugin for findbugs and PMD in library .
Clear the error request in ErrorRequestCoordinator if it’s running . \n Previously we’d never clear the error request which could lead to a \n StateVerifier exception or an object pooling error because \n primary . isLoadFailed ( ) would always return false because the state would \n be reset from failed to cleared in the call to primarly . clear ( ) on the \n line immediately above the check . \n Fixes # 2767 .
Fix an out of date OkHttp version .
Avoid looping forever on RuntimeExceptions in ConcurrencyHelper . \n If the exception threw a non - timeout exception while the debugger was \n attached , we’d busy loop until it was detached . Now we only loop while \n timeout exceptions are thrown and the debugger is attached .
Disable a wide gamut emulator test that fails only on API 27 . \n It looks like Bitmap # compress always fails on API 27 if the config is \n the new RGBA _ F16 config . The same test passes on API 26 . I’m not \n currently sure whether this is intended behavior or not in the framework \n so assuming the test for now seems reasonable .
Include default inspection profile for AS / Intellij .
Cleanup the OkHttpStreamFetcher class . \n Updates to OkHttp 3 . 9 . 1 and removes the work around made redundant by \n the new version . \n Removes some unnecessary accessor class avoidance . \n Clarifies why call is volatile and the rest of the variables are not . \n Fixes # 2355 .

Add an in config set for RGBA _ F16 in SizeConfigStrategy .
Include the debug aar in release artifacts for Android projects . \n We removed the release variant a while ago to speed up the build , which \n has the side affect of removing the release aar from artifacts . Since \n we expect the debug and release variants to be identical ( hence why \n we disabled the release variant ) , it should be safe to just use the \n debug aar instead . We will have to specify it explicitly since android’s \n rules unsurprisingly only add the release variant by default .
Add a link to the download / setup page to the README .
Avoid passing null configs to Bitmap . createBitmap in LruBitmapPool . \n We already handle null configs for our various strategies because some \n types of Bitmaps ( GIFs mostly ) on some API levels will have special \n native configs that have a null Java equivalent . As a result , \n LruBitmapPool does not throw as long as there is a matching Bitmap in \n the pool even if the config we’re asked for is null . \n This change fixes the inconsistent behavior where we would throw if \n the pool happened to not have a matching Bitmap when the given config \n is null . Now we universally handle null configs in get ( ) and getDirty ( ) .
Don’t require GifDrawables in Gallery sample . \n This is more leftover debugging code : / .

Catch / ignore SecurityException opening MediaStore thumbnails . \n A Uri permission grant for a MediaStore Uri will only grant access to the main Uri , not the thumbnail Uri . Applications that have only Uri permissions and not the storage runtime permissions will receive a SecurityException when they try to open the corresponding thumbnail . \n Prior to this change , the thumbnail exception would cause the entire \n request to fail . After this change only the thumbnail portion of the request will fail so the image may still be loaded via the original MediaStore Uri . \n Fixes # 3504 .
Wait for a post to complete before starting failing request in DrawableTransformationTest . \n Fixes # 3551 .
Avoid deadlock between SingleRequest and RequestFutureTarget . \n Clearing the Request object outside of RequestFutureTarget ' s lock should prevent the RequestFutureTarget - > Request path , which will eliminate the deadlock . Since a new Request object is created for each subsequent load , there isn ' t any risk that clearing the Request outside of the lock will end up clearing a new or restarted request . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 261721324

Create annotation glide module classes lazily but outside a lock . \n This means we might instantiate GlideModule classes multiple times if \n multiple threads race and call Glide . with ( ) . Only one instance will \n actually be used even if this happens . \n Instantiating modules outside of a lock allows to both : \n 1 . Provide an opportunity for dependency injection into GlideModule \n constructors without introducing deadlock . \n 2 . Lazily create modules . \n We could instantiate the modules exactly once if we initialize them \n eagerly , but that would slow down application startup . We can \n instantiate modules exactly once , but can introduce deadlock if \n dependency injection is used ( Glide . get ( ) acquires the Glide lock , then \n the DI lock . DI . get ( ) acquires the DI lock , then the Glide lock ) . \n The primary cost of instantiating ( and injecting ) glide modules is \n probably in the reflection and class loading . Most of that is already \n memoized , so it ' s not super expensive to do it more than once . Most \n applications won ' t race anyway , so most of the time the cost is \n effectively non - existent ( we hope ) . \n A future change will allow passing in a Context to the constructor \n of modules to allow injection in the constructors only . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 253114941

Only start RequestManagers , not lifecycles when creating with visible parents
Avoid assertions on model type in . error ( ) \n It ' s too complicated to figure out if models are likely compatible or incompatible . The current logic is broken if we have three classes , Parent , Child1 and Child2 where both the Child classes extend parent . We want Child1 and Child2 to be compatible , but they won ' t be because Child2 is not assignable to Child1 . Anything we do that ' s more sophisticated is likely to be heuristic anyway . \n Ideally we ' d just unapply the automatically applied options from the original model and apply the correct automatic options ( if any ) for the new model . Keeping track of which options can be undone and which options should be re - applied is quite difficult , in part because they automatic options could also be deliberately applied . \n Rather than do anything intelligent , we ' ll rely on callers to use the API appropriately and update the javadoc to warn more . In general I expect the common case to be matching models and there ' s a reasonable fallback if people have trouble . Unfortunately I expect this won ' t be perfect , there will be some amount of debugging caused by someone expecting or not expecting a default option : / . I think the tradeoff of not having to create a new request builder and duplicate options for that request builder is probably worth the cost . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 345085610

Reset mark position after skipping past the mark limit . Any later reset will throw instead of leaving the stream in a bad / undefined state . \n Previously , this would cause us to lose track of the bytes that were skipped . For PNGs , ExifInterface skips past the entire data block , which for some files can exceed the buffer limit . We would return back to the buffer location , decode the image partially and then try to load more from the wrapped stream - which would lead to a quick EOF \n This is similar to what fillbuf does when we push past the mark limit . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 349315836

Add a max # of bitmaps per size to store \n Also remove some logging
Allow PSR to not use recycled bitmaps \n Increases the standalone utility of the class
Allow caching of same photo in different types \n Adds an enum to be appended onto keys so that keys \n identify not just the size but also the type of \n type .
Don ' t remove all queued items if token = = null
Increase # of each bitmap type to keep around
Track bitmaps using hashcode , not the object \n Prevents us from accidently leaking bitmaps if \n we fail to call acquire and release in the correct \n order .
Only fetch missing entries in disk cache once
Don ' t cancel disk cache puts \n No point in doing the same work repeatedly , might \n as well eagerly incur the cost of putting to the \n disk cache and avoid having to resize again later .
Add more helper methods to thumb asset presenter
Don ' t try to track or recycle bitmaps if < 3 . 0
Rename stream resizer to match what it now does
Add a way to queue bitmaps that are never aquired
Fix losing track of bitmaps when they are replaced \n If the bitmap in the cache were replaced , rather \n than being evicted , the listener would not be \n notified and we would leak a reference .
Use recycled bitmaps when performing a center crop
Pass in correct value if image comes from cache
Release bitmaps when we request a new one \n Maximizes potential for recycling , each loader now \n only needs to hold on to at most one bitmap at a \n time . Before it would hold on to the old bitmap \n and request a new one , using twice the memory
Add a clear method to image loader \n Also don ' t cancel load tasks . We incur the gc \n penalty early on , so though cancelling might save \n some cpu work , it causes more gcing and worse \n performance early on because we toss the allocated \n bitmap rather than storing and reusing it .
Delay image fetch until view size is stable \n Fixes a case where we load an image for a view \n part way through a property animation so when \n the animation finishes the loaded image only fits \n in part of the view .
Reset to a placeholder when clearing a presenter
Reset to blank if no placeholder is set
Increase the odds of letting an animation finish
Clear image presenter when get a null model \n Resets the placeholder and cancels old load . \n Probably makes more sense than doing nothing \n and allowing the old load to complete
Fix exception when disk cache dir is null
Only touch bitmap cache on one thread \n avoid extra locking
Don ' t check disk cache if not using disk cache
Increase odds of recycled bitmaps being available \n Occasionally loads seemd to be happening before \n the corresponding loader ' s release of its previous \n bitmaps which lead to lots more allocing then \n we expected

Be more paranoid about catching disk cache excepts \n Some weird race conditions around image saving \n and cache opening / closing .
Abort can throw same illegal state as commit \n So don ' t try to abort if disk cache is closed and \n catch all errors in error handeling code so we \n don ' t cause a crash trying to abort a failed \n commit
Be more paranoid about threading in disk cache \n This is not really a solution , but in case \n open and close overlap because of actions on \n background threads started by two different \n image managers , this will at least let state \n be consistent . Needs more work to avoid this \n problem .
Handle cache dirs being null + build version check \n Apparently either get cache dir method can return \n null in some circumstances . If one does , try the \n other , if both do , return null . The image manager \n will just not use a disk cache if the cache \n dir is null . Environment . \n isExternalStorageRemovable is api 9 + and we \n support 8 , so add a check before using it .
Don ' acquire bitmap for memory cache when not used
Avoid NPE when bitmap ' s config is null . . .
Add method to manually set dimens on presenters
remove recycle calls \n Sometimes the recycled bitmap is actually returned \n and displayed - > an exception
Don ' t log verbosely unless explicitly enabled
Revert to holding strong references during loads \n This fixes a bug where a load may silently fail to \n complete if the user passes in a target and does \n not retain a reference to the target for the \n duration of the load .
Allow match _ parent / wrap _ content view dimensions \n By default if the view has wrap _ content for either \n the width or the height ( or both ) , we will load \n the image in at the original size . Trying to apply \n either FitCenter or CenterCrop to the load will \n still result in an exception since we would need \n concrete sizes to transform the image .
Fix race causing two loads to use same bitmap
Use a dequeue instead of linked list in sbc
Fix race causing bitmaps to be recycled 2 + times
Don ' t pool bitmaps with null configs \n They will cause an IllegalArgumentException in \n some cases if passed in to decodeStream as \n inBitmap .

Add rules to build glide as a . jar \n Makes glide not a library project by default , \n although all that is really needed to use it \n as a library project is to just add \n android . library = true to project . properties again

Fix mark position causing gcs \n if mark position > bytes size , the input stream \n will eventually allocate a new buffer up to the \n mark position . This prevents those extra \n allocations .
Stop load in ImagePresenter if id or opener = null
do bitmap ref management on a bg thread \n Reduces the number of locks the main thread needs \n to acquire and the amount of time they need to be \n held ( as well as the contention for said locks )
Fix extra allocations when marklimit > buffer size \n BufferedInputStream would double the buffer size \n each time it read from the input stream if \n mark limit > buffer size , including the first time \n before any data is read . This change prevents the \n buffer size from being increased until after at \n least one buffer worth of data is read . In turn \n this reduces gcs with a large mark limit relative \n to the buffer size .
Add a default exception handler to log exceptions \n previously they were caught silently
Update mark limit and buffer size in ImageResizer
Throw an exception if model stream loader not set
Allow DiskLruCacheWrapper to throw IOException \n Allows us to log and monitor the exception as well \n as forcing us to handle the default case
Run resize tasks in our thread pool \n Previously would have run them on whatever thread \n the callback was called on , which may have been \n some external library ' s thread .
Add a BaseModelLoader \n Allows us to remove the repetitive \n ModelLoader . close ( ) - > StreamOpener . cancel ( )
Clear loaders before load in ImagePresenter \n Allows us not to call clear before new loads in \n all of the loaders
Make compression quality to diskcache configurable \n Also decrease the default from 100 to 90 .

Simplify StringLoader to take UriLoader \n eliminates the weird dependency on UrlLoader in \n StringLoader
Add methods to set placeholders in Glide . load

Compile volley as a jar and not a library project
Remove set default options in ImageManager \n Simpler interface if people just set instances of \n default disk / memory cache that they create
Make DiskLruCacheWrapper a singleton \n Makes it more apparent that options can only bet \n set once , rather than each time a new wrapper is \n created
Move getMaxCacheSize to ImaageManager \n Similar method to getPhotoCache , so might as well \n be in the same place

Allow arbitrary uri loader in resource loader \n Lets us use factory for uris rather than relying \n on our specific implementation
Don ' t override equals / hashcode in metadata
Handle image views that aren ' t targets in cancel
Allow ModelLoaders to return null values \n This allows models to sometimes , but not always , \n have an associated image . If a ModelLoader returns \n null , we will assume there is no image associated \n with that particular model instance and show \n the placeholder .
Make buildModelLoader a static method on Glide \n It ' s not a setter , so it might as well have the \n slightly simpler static syntax .
Add version name to Glide jars in ant
Bump version to 2 . 0 . 0
Add start / stop to disk cache \n If you open an already open disk cache you corrupt \n the journal which wipes the cache . This is an \n effort to avoid that behavior .

Prevent Fabric from changing props if they are managed by Animated \n Summary : \n Changelog : [ internal ] \n # Problem \n Fabric doesn ' t know when NativeAnimatedModule control a prop and overrides its change whenever any prop changes .

Fix conditions to fire onLayout event \n Summary : \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n # Problem \n # # Step 1 \n JS clones a node that has size { 100 , 100 } and changes props that cause the node to increase size to { 200 , 200 } . JS holds pointer to this node . \n Now , the size ( stored in LayoutableShadowNode . layoutMetrics _ ) changes after Yoga layout is triggered . \n However , the node gets cloned inside State Reconciliation before Yoga layout phase . The JS pointer points to a node with size { 100 , 100 } , not to a node with size { 200 , 200 } . \n # # Step 2 \n Again , JS clones node ( with old reference , therefore gets old layoutMetrics _ with size { 100 , 100 } ) and it changes props that cause the node to decrease its size back to { 100 , 100 } . \n We go all the way to Yoga layout and looking for nodes that have been affected by the node . The node , affected by the layout because it went from { 200 , 200 } to { 100 , 100 } , will be evaluated as not affected . This causes onLayout event to not be fired . \n # Fix \n We can safely remove the frame equality check ( please see below ) .

Make sure opacity and transform are applied in native animation \n Summary : \n Changelog : [ internal ] \n Problem : \n ` props . transform ` gets out of sync with ` self . layer . transform ` . \n To avoid writing out value of transform matrix , in the follow example I will only consider identity matrix and non - identity matrix . It is sufficient to demonstrate the point . \n 1 . View is reused with transform being something besides identity . This causes ` props . transform ` and ` self . layer . transform ` to be non - identity . \n 2 . View is taken from pool and animated with transform set to non - identity . \n 3 . React JS props arrive and set ` view . props ` to identity but ` self . layer . transform ` stays unchanged because it is managed by native animation . This is the point where ` props . transform ` and ` self . layer . transform ` get out of sync . \n 4 . Native animation wants to set transform to identity to finish the animation . But inside ` [ RCTViewComponentView updateProps : oldProps : ] ` ` self . layer . transform ` does not get set because current ` view . props ` is already identity . \n Solution : \n After native animation layer calls ` [ RCTViewComponentView updateProps : oldProps : ] ` , verify that values were set .

Cancel touches if surface touch handler can be prevented | second try \n Summary : \n Changelog : [ internal ] \n Previous implementation , ( D25684453 ( https : / / github . com / facebook / react - native / commit / eba31d285847ef70cf22ce83fe013efa95416e3c ) ) which was backed out , had a bug that caused assert to fail . It was restarting internal state ` RCTSurfaceTouchHandler ` and lead to inconsistency . \n This is because touch event is a state machine and before " moved " is called , touch event had to " began " . With internal state being restarted , that wasn ' t the case . \n In the previous implementation the internal state was incorrectly restarted because I thought touches would not longer receive touch events after declaring that UIGestureRecogniser shouldn ' t be recognised simultaneously . \n In this diff I take a different approach . Instead of restarting the internal state , the recogniser is first disabled and then enabled again . This cancels any ongoing touches instead of manual cleanup . \n # # # Other approaches \n In the UIViewController , we could listen to ` viewWillDisappear ` message and cancel any ongoing touches on the surface . This would work as well ( it would prevent Pressable components from being highlighted during interactive view controller dismissal ) however we would need to expose existence of ` RCTTouchHandler ` to the view controller . This approach is also discouraged in D15734129 ( https : / / github . com / facebook / react - native / commit / 36307d87e1974aff1abac598da2fd11c4e8e23c1 ) . \n Reviewed By : shergin \n Differential Revision : D25685536 \n fbshipit - source - id : ad226c82e73f841c1ebd9b92738847cc5cdc21d1

JdkSslContext supported cipher suites incorrect \n Motivation : \n JdkSslContext builds the list of supported cipher suites , but assumes that ciphers prefixed with SSL _ and TLS _ will be interchangeable .

Http2FrameCodec WindowUpdate bug \n Motivation : \n Http2FrameCodec increases the initialWindowSize when the user attempts to increase the connection flow control window .

KQueue write filter initial state ( # 7738 ) \n Motivation : \n KQueue implementations current have inconsistent behavior with Epoll implementations with respect to asynchronous sockets and connecting . In the Epoll transport we attempt to connect , if the connect call does not synchornously fail / succeed we set the EPOLLOUT which will be triggered by the kernel if the connection attempt succeeds or an error occurs . The connect API provides no way to asynchronously communicate an error so the Epoll implementation fires a EPOLLOUT event and puts the connect status in getsockopt ( SO _ ERROR ) . KQueue provides the same APIs but different behavior . If the EVFILT _ WRITE is not enabled and the EVFILT _ READ is enabled before connect is called , and there is an error the kernel may fire the EVFILT _ READ filter and provide the Connection Refused error via read ( ) . This is even true if we set the EVFILT _ WRITE filter after calling connect because connect didn ' t synchornously complete . After the error has been delievered via read ( ) a call to getsockopt ( SO _ ERROR ) will return 0 indicating there is no error . This means we cannot rely upon the KQueue based kernel to deliver connection errors via the EVFILT _ WRITE filter in the same way that the linux kernel does with the EPOLLOUT flag . \n ce241bd introduced a change which depends upon the behavior of the EVFILT _ WRITE being set and may prematurely stop writing to the OS as a result , becaues we assume the OS will notify us when the socket is writable . However the current work around for the above described behavior is to initialize the EVFILT _ WRITE to true for connection oriented protocols . This leads to prematurely exiting from the flush ( ) which may lead to deadlock . \n Modifications : \n - KQueue should check when an error is obtained from read ( ) if the connectPromise has not yet been completed , and if not complete it with a ConnectException \n Result : \n No more deadlock in KQueue due to asynchronous connect workaround .

However if the ByteBuf is a CompositeByteBuf with more than 1 components , the write will fail and throw an exception . \n Modifications : \n - NioDatagramChannel should check the nioBufferCount before attempting \n to use internalNioBuffer \n Result : \n No more failure to write UDP packets on NIO when a CompositeByteBuf is \n used .
Revert " Revert " SslHandler avoid calling wrap / unwrap when unnecessary " " \n Motivation : \n PR https : / / github . com / netty / netty / pull / 6803 corrected an error in the return status of the OpenSslEngine . We should now be able to restore the SslHandler optimization . \n Modifications : \n - This reverts commit 7f3b75a5091dcd6d882102fdb92daa6931e02c30 . \n Result : \n SslHandler optimization is restored .
Remove io . netty . packagePrefix system property \n Motivation : \n Now that the NativeLibraryLoader implicitly detects the shaded package prefix we no longer need the io . netty . packagePrefix system property . \n Modifications : \n - Remove io . netty . packagePrefix processing from NativeLibraryLoader \n Result : \n Code is cleaner .
SslHandler aggregation prefer copy over CompositeByteBuf \n Motivation : \n SslHandler will do aggregation of writes by default in an attempt to improve goodput and reduce the number of discrete buffers which must be accumulated . However if aggregation is not possible then a CompositeByteBuf is used to accumulate multiple buffers . Using a CompositeByteBuf doesn ' t provide any of the benefits of better goodput and in the case of small + large writes ( e . g . http / 2 frame header + data ) this can reduce the amount of data that can be passed to writev by about half . This has the impact of increasing latency as well as reducing goodput . \n Modifications : \n - SslHandler should prefer copying instead of using a CompositeByteBuf \n Result : \n Better goodput ( and potentially improved latency ) at the cost of copy operations .
UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProviderTest failure \n Motivation : \n InetSocketAddress # getHostName ( ) may attempt a reverse lookup which may lead to test failures because the expected address will not match . \n Modifications : \n - Use InetSocketAddress # getHostString ( ) which will not attempt any lookups and instead return the original String \n Result : \n UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProviderTest is more reliable .
UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider should allow for empty / etc / resolver dir \n Motivation : \n UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider currently throws an exception if / etc / resolver exists but it empty . This shouldn ' t be an exception and can be tolerated as if there is no contribution from / etc / resolver . \n Modifications : \n - Treat / etc / resolver as present and empty the same as not being present \n Result : \n UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider initialization can tolerate empty / etc / resolver directory .
SslHandlerTest # testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite debug info \n Motivation : \n SslHandlerTest # testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite has been observed to fail on CI servers . Knowing how many bytes were seen by the client would be helpful . \n Modifications : \n - Add bytesSeen to the exception if the client closes early . \n Result : \n More debug info available .
SslHandler leak \n Motivation : \n SslHandler only supports ByteBuf objects , but will not release objects of other types . SslHandler will also not release objects if its internal state is not correctly setup . \n Modifications : \n - Release non - ByteBuf objects in write \n - Release all objects if the SslHandler queue is not setup \n Result : \n Less leaks in SslHandler .
KQueue crash due to close / cleanup sequencing \n Motivation : \n The kqueue documentation states that ' Calling close ( ) on a file descriptor will remove any kevents that reference the descriptor . ' [ 1 ] , but doesn ' t mention if this cleanup will be done synchronously . Under some circumstances it has been observed that cleanup was not done immediately and when KQueueEventLoop attempted to access the channel associated with the event the JVM would crash , a ClassCastException , or generally undefined behavior would occur because of invalid pointer references . \n [ 1 ] https : / / www . freebsd . org / cgi / man . cgi ? query = kqueue & sektion = 2 \n Modifications : \n - AbstractKqueueChannel # doClose should not rely upon this assumption and instead should call doDeregister ( ) to ensure cleanup is done synchronously . \n - Deleting a kevent should also set the jniSelfPtr stored in the udata of that kevent to NULL , to ensure we will not dereference it later . \n Result : \n No more kqueue crash due to close / cleanup sequencing .
Http2FrameLogger frame labels incorrect \n Motivation : \n The labels identifying the frame types in Http2FrameLogger are not always correct . \n Modification : \n - Correct the string labels to indicate the right frame type in Http2FrameLogger \n Result : \n Logs are more correct .
SslHandler promise completion incorrect if write doesn ' t immediately \n complete \n Motivation : \n SslHandler removes a Buffer / Promise pair from \n AbstractCoalescingBufferQueue when wrapping data . However it is possible \n the SSLEngine will not consume the entire buffer . In this case \n SslHandler adds the Buffer back to the queue , but doesn ' t add the \n Promise back to the queue . This may result in the promise completing \n immediately in finishFlush , and generally not correlating to the \n completion of writing the corresponding Buffer \n Modifications : \n - AbstractCoalescingBufferQueue # addFirst should also support adding the \n ChannelPromise \n - In the event of a handshake timeout we should immediately fail pending \n writes immediately to get a more accurate exception \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7378 .
Increase timeout for DnsNameResolverTest \n Motivation : \n DnsNameResolverTest has been observed to timeout on the CI servers . We should increase the timeout from 5 seconds to 30 seconds . \n Modifications : \n - Increase timeout from 5 to 30 seconds . \n Result : \n Less false failures due to slower CI machines .
Increase visibility for SslHandlerTest # testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite \n Motivation : \n SslHandlerTest # testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite has been observed to fail on CI servers , but it is not clear why . \n Modifications : \n - Add more visibility into what the state was and what the condition that caused the failure was . \n Result : \n More visibility when the test fails .
SslHandlerTest # testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite print SslProvider on failure \n Motivation : \n When SslHandlerTest # testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite fails it would be useful to know the SslProvider type \n Modifications : \n - Print the sever and client SslProvider upon failure \n - Increase test timeout to 8 minutes to allow more time to run \n Result : \n Failures include more info to help diagnose issues .
OpenSsl should use _ instead of - \n Motivation : \n netty - tcnative recently change the name of the native libraries from using - to _ . \n Modifications : \n - OpenSsl should use _ instead of - even for the classifiers to be consistent with netty - tcnative \n Result : \n Loading netty - tcnative works .
AbstractChannel should call doClose even after shutdownOutput \n Motivation : \n ShutdownOutput now fails all pending writes in the ChannelOutboundBuffer and sets it to null . However the Close code path uses the ChannelOutboundBuffer as an indication that the close operation is in progress and exits early and will not call doClose . This will lead to the Channel not actually being fully closed . \n Bug introduced by 237a4da1b76ef7f303eca8f6ec8539efc9fe4d26 \n Modifications : \n - AbstractChannel # close shouldn ' t exit early just because outboundBuffer is null , and instead should use additional state closeInitiated to avoid duplicate close operations \n Result : \n AbstractChannel # close ( . . ) after AbstractChannel # shutdownOutbound ( ) will still invoke doClose and cleanup Channel state .
HttpObjectEncoder buffer size estimation \n Motivation : \n HttpObjectEncoder allocates a new buffer when encoding the initial line and headers , and also allocates a buffer when encoding the trailers . The allocation always uses the default size of 256 . This may lead to consistent under allocation and require a few resize / copy operations which can cause GC / memory pressure . \n Modifications : \n - Introduce a weighted average which tracks the historical size of encoded data and uses this as an estimate for future buffer allocations \n Result : \n Better approximation of buffer sizes .
NativeLibraryLoader logging clarify \n Motivation : \n NativeLibraryLoader may only log a debug statement if the library is successfully loaded from java . library . path , but will log failure statements the if load for java . library . path fails which can mislead users to believe the load actually failed when it may have succeeded . \n Modifications : \n - Always load a debug statement when a library was successfully loaded \n Result : \n NativeLibraryLoader log statements more clear .
Set readPending to false when ever a read is done \n Motivation : \n readPending is currently only set to false if data is delivered to the application , however this may result in duplicate events being received from the selector in the event that the socket was closed . \n Modifications : \n - We should set readPending to false before each read attempt for all \n transports besides NIO . \n - Based upon the Javadocs it is possible that NIO may have spurious \n wakeups [ 1 ] . In this case we should be more cautious and only set \n readPending to false if data was actually read . \n [ 1 ] https : / / docs . oracle . com / javase / 7 / docs / api / java / nio / channels / SelectionKey . html \n That a selection key ' s ready set indicates that its channel is ready for some operation category is a hint , but not a guarantee , that an operation in such a category may be performed by a thread without causing the thread to block . \n Result : \n Notification from the selector ( or simulated events from kqueue / epoll ET ) in the event of socket closure . \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 7255
SslHandler dervies jdkCompatibilityMode from SSLEngine \n Motivation : \n Some SSLEngine implementations ( e . g . ReferenceCountedOpenSslContext ) support unwrapping / wrapping multiple packets at a time . The SslHandler behaves differently if the SSLEngine supports this feature , but currently requires that the constructor argument between the SSLEngine creation and SslHandler are coordinated . This can be difficult , or require package private access , if extending the SslHandler . \n Modifications : \n - The SslHandler should inspect the SSLEngine to see if it supports jdkCompatibilityMode instead of relying on getting an extra constructor argument which maybe out of synch with the SSLEngine \n Result : \n Easier to override SslHandler and have consistent jdkCompatibilityMode between SSLEngine and SslHandler .
SocketGatheringWriteTest increase timeouts \n Motivation : \n EpollDomainSocketGatheringWriteTest . testGatheringWriteBig takes on average about 20 - 25 seconds on the CI servers , but there is a 30 second timeout being applied which leads to what maybe false positive test failures . \n Modifications : \n - Increase the test timeout to 120 seconds globally and 60 seconds to wait for all writes per test \n Result : \n Higher timeout for potentially less false positive test failures .
HttpConversionUtils avoid intermediate collection allocation \n Modifications : \n HttpConversionUtil # toLowercaseMap requires an intermediate List to be allocated . This can be avoided with the recently added value iterator methods . \n Modifications : \n - Use HttpHeaders # valueCharSequenceIterator instead of getAll \n Result : \n Less intermediate object allocation and copying .
Reduce conditionals in DnsNameResovlerContext \n Motivation : \n Minor cleanup from 844d804 just to reduce the conditional statements and indentation level . \n Modifications : \n - combine the else + if into an else if statement \n Result : \n Code cleaned up .
Http2ConnectionHandler Http2ConnectionPrefaceAndSettingsFrameWrittenEvent propagation \n Motivation : \n Http2ConnectionHandler uses ctx . fireUserEvent to propagate the Http2ConnectionPrefaceAndSettingsFrameWrittenEvent through the pipeline . This will propagate the event to the next inbound handler in the pipeline . If the user extends Http2ConnectionHandler the Http2ConnectionPrefaceAndSettingsFrameWrittenEvent may be missed and initialization dependent upon this event will not be run . \n Modifications : \n - Http2ConnectionHandler should use userEventTriggered instead of ctx . fireUserEvent \n Result : \n Classes that extend Http2ConnectionHandler will see the Http2ConnectionPrefaceAndSettingsFrameWrittenEvent user event .
DNS Resovler tests should be more explicit about ndots \n Motivation : \n The DNS resolver may use default configuration inherited from the environment . This means the ndots value may change and result in test failure if the tests don ' t explicitly set the assumed value . \n Modifications : \n - Explicitly set ndots in resolver - dns unit tests so we don ' t fail if the environment overrides the search domain and ndots \n Result : \n Unit tests are less dependent upon the enviroment they run in . \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 6966 .
Increase test timeout for SocketStringEchoTest \n Motivation : \n SocketStringEchoTest has been observed to fail on CI servers , but the stack traces still indicate work was being done . \n Modifications : \n - Increase the test timeout \n Result : \n Tests have more time to complete , and hopefully less false positive test failures .
HpackDecoder # addHeader has an unused parameter \n Motivation : \n HpackDecoder # addHeader takes in the streamId as a parameter but no longer uses it . \n Modifications : \n - Remove the streamId parameter from HpackDecoder # addHeader \n Result : \n Less unused parameters in HpackDecoder .
Http2FrameCodecTest increase timeout \n Motivation : \n Http2FrameCodecTest # newOutboundStream has a timeout of 1 second and has been observed to timeout on CI servers . \n Modifications : \n - Increase the timeout to 5 seconds \n Result : \n Less false positive test failures on CI servers .
Test output should include GC details \n Motivation : \n Our tests are often asynchronous and have timeouts to avoid hanging indefinitely . However sometimes the timeouts maybe set to low for the CI servers . It would be helpful to confirm if the application was busy with GC and if that was a contributing factor to the test timing out . \n Modifications : \n - Unit tests should run with - XX : + PrintGCDetails by default \n Result : \n More visibility into GC behavior in unit tests .
DnsNameResovlerContext # followCname sending extra queries \n Motivation : \n When following a CNAME response DnsNameResovlerContext may issue a A and AAAA query . However the DnsNameResolverContext would have already issued a A and AAAA query to get the CNAME response , and this may result in 2 additional A / AAAA queries per CNAME response . \n Modifications : \n - DnsNameResovlerContext # followCname shouldn ' t issue 2 queries , but instead just a single query with the same record type as the original query \n Result : \n No more duplicate queries as a result of CNAME responses .
DnsNameResolverContext reuse of DnsServerAddressStream without duplicate \n Motivation : \n DnsServerAddressStream provides an iterator like interface but maybe expected to start at a specific point upon each new usage . If a DnsServerAddressStream is re - used in multiple independent iterations the order of iteration maybe incorrect . DnsNameResolverContext has a fallback DnsServerAddressStream reference if the cache doesn ' t contain a hit , but it is shared across multiple independent iterations . This may lead to undesirable DNS query order . \n Modifications : \n - DnsNameResolverContext # getNameServers should duplicate the default DnsServerAddressStream \n Result : \n Consistent iteration over the default DnsServerAddressStream in DnsNameResolverContext .
EmptyHeaders get with default value returns null \n Motivation : \n EmptyHeaders # get with a default value argument returns null . It should never return null , and instead it should return the default value . \n Modifications : \n - EmptyHeaders # get with a default value should return that default value \n Result : \n More correct implementation of the Headers API .
HpackDecoderTest cleanup \n Motivation : \n public ExpectedException fields should be final . \n setUp method signature has a throws , but it isn ' t necessary
ObjectCleaner may indefinitely block on ReferenceQueue # poll \n Motivation : \n ObjectCleaner polls a ReferenceQueue which will block indefinitely . However it is possible there is a race condition between the live set of objects being empty due to the WeakReference being cleaned / cleared and polling the queue . If this situation occurs the cleanup thread may never unblock if no more objects are added to the live set , and may result in an application ' s failure to gracefully close . \n Modifications : \n - ReferenceQueue . remove should use a timeout to compensate for the race condition , and avoid dead lock \n Result : \n No more dead lock in ObjectCleaner when polling the ReferenceQueue .
Simplify CharSequenceValueConverter # convertToBoolean \n Motivation : \n CharSequenceValueConverter # convertToBoolean has a few manual conditionals which can be removed if we use AsciiString . contentEqualsIgnoreCase . Also by comparing an AsciiString to a String we will incur conversions to char that can be avoided if we compare against AsciiString . \n Modifications : \n - Use AsciiString . contentEqualsIgnoreCase \n - Compare against a AsciiString \n Result : \n Simplified CharSequenceValueConverter # convertToBoolean which favors AsciiString comparison .
netty _ unix _ socket free nettyClassName after using it \n Motivation : \n netty _ unix _ socket attempts to use nettyClassName in an error message , but previously freed the memory . We should wait to free the memory until after we use it . \n Modifications : \n - Free nettyClassName after using it in snprintf \n Result : \n More useful error message .
Reduce the default number of objects retained by the Recycler per thread \n Motivation : \n The Recycler currently retains 32k objects per thread by default . The Recycler is used in more than just one place and may result in large amounts of memory bloat if spikes of traffic are observed . \n Modifications : \n - Reduce the Recyclers default capacity from 32k to 4k . \n Result : \n - Lower default capacity of the Recycler and less memory retained .
SmtpRequestEncoderTest ByteBuf leak ( # 9075 ) \n Motivation : \n SmtpRequestEncoderTest # testThrowsIfContentExpected has a ByteBuf leak . \n Modifications : \n - SmtpRequestEncoderTest # testThrowsIfContentExpected should release buffers in a finally block \n Result : \n No more leaks in SmtpRequestEncoderTest # testThrowsIfContentExpected .

[ konan . properties ] Add missing sigil
Use gold linker instead of lld on Windows and Linux \n lld is doing something wrong for linux _ arm32 _ hfp and linux _ arm64 targets , so we fallback to gold linker on Linux and Windows . \n See KT - 41725 and KT - 42446
Move crt * files location to konan . properties
[ KT - 40670 ] Allow override konan . properties \n It is painful to edit konan . properties just to override some value ( e . g . compiler flags or LLVM location ) , especially if it is needed only in a single project . Thus ` - Xoverride - konan - properties ` is added .
[ LLVM ] [ Optimizations ] Add verbose output \n Verbose output allows to observe ` - Xoverride - konan - properties ` changes .

[ konan . properties ] Make gccToolchain a target property \n Previously , we used the same gccToolchain for all linux - based targets . It is dangerous because sysroot and toolchain might be incompatible . Since c82b843e we moved to unified and reproducible way to build toolchains , so we have a separate gccToolchain for each target .
[ ClangArgs ] use - - sysroot for all targets \n Change ` - isysroot ` to ` - - sysroot ` because it is the same thing on darwin targets .
[ ClangArgs ] Move sysroot setting to single place

Add new stage state FINISHED _ TASK _ SCHEDULING \n This stage indicates that current stage finished task scheduling , \n but the split scheduling has not started yet . In recoverable grouped \n execution , this stage is not trivial because split scheduling happens \n after all splits loaded .
Refactor TestHiveSplitSource \n - Use lambda for thread creation \n - Remove unnecessary final declaration \n - Create thread pool in test class that is shared across all unit tests
Update task info when task fails \n With recoverable grouped execution , failed task does not \n necessarily fail the whole query . Not updating task info makes \n query unable to finish in tests because failed task is stuck \n in RUNNING state .
Remove ValuesNode verification in ApplyConnectorOptimization \n IndexSourceNode could also hit this code path and the planning would \n fail . This verification does not seem useful so we ' d rather remove \n it instead of enhancing it .
Fix grouped execution tagging for table scan \n We should return incapable for table scan in the following two cases : \n - TablePartitioing is empty \n - TablePartitioning is not empty but it only contains one \n NotPartitionedPartitionHandle in the partition handle list \n The first case is already covered , and this commit is aiming \n at fixing the second case .
Rename allNodes to NodeByTaskId \n The index of the list is actually the task id , which is not exposed \n by the previous name , and might lead to confusion
Support bucket - to - node update in DynamicLifespanScheduler \n For recoverable grouped execution , a bucket is possible to change \n the assigned node if the previous run fails
Mark unpartitioned table in HiveWrittenPartitions \n We already use " < UNPARTITIONED > " for unpartitioned table input , and \n this commit would unify the representation of unpartitioned table in \n output as well .
Adjust timeout for TestHiveSplitSource \n This reduces flakiness for testReaderWaitsForSplits and \n make testEmptyBucket fail faster instead of hang forever
Rename finish ( ) to noMoreSplits ( ) for PerBucket \n Having both finish ( ) and isFinished ( ) is confusing because they are \n talking about different events . finish ( ) is called when \n BackgroundHiveSplitLoader notifies HiveSplitSource that no more \n splits will be enumerated , whereas isFinished ( ) is used to determine \n if all the splits have been fully fetched . We renmae finish ( ) to \n noMoreSplits ( ) to avoid this confusion .
Fix removeRemoteSource to allow NO _ CONTENT response \n Currently there is no entity in the response of \n TaskResource # removeRemoteSource , so the response code is 204 .
Add SUPPORTS _ REWINDABLE _ SPLIT _ SOURCE to Hive connector capabilities
Use getLocationService ( ) in AbstractTestHiveClient \n Using locationService member variable directly doesn ' t work when a test \n overwrites getLocationService ( ) .
Improve testIllegalStorageFormatDuringTableScan \n Provide both schema name and table name when listing columns . It \n is not necessary to list all tables to achieve the goal of the test .
Static import Streams # stream and Math # max in BackgroundHiveSplitLoader
Run recoverable grouped execution test in a separate build
Disable TestHiveRecoverableGroupedExecution \n This test is still flaky even if only enabling one test , which \n means it needs more investigation .
Disable TestHiveRecoverableGroupedExecution \n TestHiveRecoverableGroupedExecution has become flaky and it is \n likely due to force closing worker in DistributedQueryRunner \n won ' t close cleanly and thus impact later tests . We should \n reintroduce this test when we could deflake it , for example , \n have a better way to inject failure .
Add assertion in TableFinishOperator \n When running in recoverable grouped execution mode , We should \n fail the query if we received a page for a committed lifespan \n and stage from the same task whose written data is committed . \n Otherwise we would silently corrupt the data .
Use uuid for temp file when writing sorted table \n Currently the temp file name for sorted table is in the format of \n query _ id + bucket _ number + increasing _ number _ from _ 0 . This has the \n potential of leading to corruption when a query is running in \n recoverable grouped execution mode . Assuming a task " fake died " and \n we schedule the bucket to another task , then these two tasks will \n be working on the same set of temp file names . \n To fix this , instead of using an increasing number from 0 , we use \n uuid to avoid name clashing .
Use TableWriterMergeNode to check recoverability \n After we introduced TableWriterMergeNode , the root node of writer \n fragment is TableWriterMergeNode , so we should use TableWriterMergeNode \n to check recoverability . \n To make sure this is properly tested , this change would also enable \n only two tests in TestHiveRecoverableGroupedExecution . This test is \n known to be flaky when we run too many tests because GC would slow \n down query execution and cause timeout . Only enabling one seems \n a reasonable compromise .
Remove synchronized method in FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler \n This would resolve a deadlock for the following scenario : \n - SqlStageExecution # updateTaskStatus calls FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler # recover \n - FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler # schedule calls SqlStageExecution # scheduleSplits \n However , in SqlStageExecution , both updateTaskStatus and scheduleSplits \n are synchronized , while in FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler , both \n schedule and recover are both synchronized . Thus there is a \n deadlock . \n Instead of making schedule ( ) and recover ( ) synchronized , we could \n do recover job at the begining of schedule ( ) . We use a non - blocking \n concurrent queue to store the tasks to be recovered , and make \n recover ( ) to be the producer and schedule ( ) to be the consumer \n of the queue .
Extract common logic in HiveLocationService \n Remove code duplication for LocationHandle creation logic in forNewTable \n and forExisitingTable
Fix stripe metadata cache weigher to use retained size
Materialize stripe stream slice when caching \n This would make cached slice only contain required data , otherwise \n we will cache all the data in base for this slice , even when \n we only need a view from it .
Reorder methods in HiveClientConfig \n Put getters above the corresponding setters
Optimize createPredicate in getTableLayout \n Since hive partition columns have exact values , we could deduplicate \n before creating SortedRangeSet , whose sorting could be very expensive \n when there are multiple partition columns and large number of \n partitions , and this sorting would happen multiple times during \n the query planning stage due to table layout related optimizations \n like filter pushdown .
Fix recoverable grouped execution eligibility \n We should only allow recoverable grouped execution when table \n writer merge operator is enabled to avoid enabling for cases \n where there are parallel table writer operators , otherwise there \n would be multiple " last page " from one task , and thus fail the \n sanity checkState check . \n This could be removed after we remove control flag for table writer \n merge operator .
Make equals ( ) and hashCode ( ) consistent in TableHandle
Allow Raptor to run custom check before table creation
Refactor testNoHangIfPartitionIsOffline \n - Use method reference \n - Remove redundant " throws Exception "
Reduce the number of Callable for testCachingDirectoryLister \n Creating 1000 Callable means we will need to create 1000 threads , \n which could be expensive memory - wise and crash the test
Fix ValuesMatcher \n - Fix StringLiteral generation by creating string instead of using \n toString value of Slice , which only includes base / address / length . \n - Use Set instead of List for expected rows . The row sequence does not \n impact correctness .
Allow EnforceSingleRowNode for predicate extractor \n Assuming we have a daily ingested table that is partitioned on ds , \n a filter like ` ds = ( SELECT ' 2020 - 07 - 01 ' ) ` is converted into an \n INNER JOIN , but this value is not passed to the other side of Join , \n which leads to full table scan . \n This commit will enable this value being treated as predicate , and \n thus we only need to read this one partition .
Fix hamming _ distance to handle code point zero \n Currently when code point zero is encountered in hamming _ distance , \n we treat it as 0 - length , which would fail the position check for \n legit comparison .

The only groups that don ' t \n report issues are accessibility , reference and syntax . But syntax has \n to be disabled for Javadoc because the Hamcrest classes are reporting \n syntax issues . \n Additionally doclint is disabled for JDK < 8 , because the - Xdoclint \n argument causes a failing build in JDKs before JDK 8 .

Use compilerArgs instead of compilerArguments . \n The parameter compilerArguments is deprecated .
Don ' t verify the visibility of a method ' s declaring class . \n I would not expect FrameworkMethod . validatePublicVoid ( . . . ) to test \n visibility of the declaring class . Since the last commit the runner \n itself verifies that a test class is public . Hence we can safely remove \n this validation from FrameworkMethod . \n This fixes # 749 ( JUnit cannot be build with JDK 8 ) , too .
Build JUnit with JDK 8 on Travis . \n We can now build JUnit with JDK 8 , because # 749 is fixed .
Remove redundant exception from method signature . \n A more general exception is already part of the signature .
Restore field names with f prefix . Fixes # 960 . \n The prefix has been removed by df00d5eced3a7737b88de0f6f9e3673f0cf88f88 , \n because we changed the coding style . Unfortunately IntelliJ IDEA reads \n ClassRequest . fTestClass and FilterRequest . fFilter via reflection . ( See \n http : / / grepcode . com / file / repository . grepcode . com / java / ext / com . jetbrains / intellij - idea / 13 . 0 . 0 / com / intellij / junit4 / JUnit4IdeaTestRunner . java / ) This makes it impossible to \n start tests by using IntelliJ IDEA . \n There is already an issue at JetBrains : \n [ IDEA - 127349 ] ( http : / / youtrack . jetbrains . com / issue / IDEA - 127349 ) We can \n revert the fix when this ticket is solved and most users are using an \n IntelliJ version with the fix .
Fix version range for restict - doclint .

Increase running time of statement . Fixes # 963 . \n The time between starting the statement and calling the future is \n arbitrary . Now the execution time of the statement is very very long . \n This ensures that the statement is not already finished when the \n future is called .
Avoid repeated checks . \n The only check is ` assertNoDescendantsHaveCategoryAnnotations ` . It \n checks all descendants . Hence further calls of \n ` assertNoCategorizedDescendentsOfUncategorizeableParents ` for each \n child are redundant , because it has already been checked .
Use a smaller DURATION _ THAT _ EXCEEDS _ TIMEOUT value . \n Integer . MAX _ VALUE might cause problems in some implementations .
Restore folder ` javadoc / latest ` for Javadoc . \n This folder has been used for many years . There are links to Javadoc at \n that folder ( e . g . http : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 156503 / how - do - you - assert - that - a - certain - exception - is - thrown - in - junit - 4 - tests / 2935935 # 2935935 ) . \n Restoring the folder ` javadoc / latest ` will hopefully restore the \n Javadoc pages in Google Search , too .

Separate tests for failure and run count . \n A test should only test a single thing .
Remove some tests . \n We don ' t have to test the test and failure naming for tests with \n @ Parameter annotation again , because it is not different from the test \n that sets the parameters via constructor .
Make injection type explicit . \n Makes it easier to understand the code .
Improve test method name . \n Replace ` assumeNotNullSingleNullThrowsException ` by \n ` assumeNotNullThrowsExceptionForNullArray ` because it is more clear .
Provide helpful message if parameter cannot be set . \n For private @ Parameter fields is users get an exception like \n " java . lang . IllegalAccessException : Class . . . can not access a member \n of class X with modifiers private " The new message " Cannot set \n parameter ' parameter ' . Ensure that the the field ' parameter ' is \n public . " tells the user what they should do . \n The reason for adding this feature is the Stackoverflow question \n https : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 44522046 / reflection - exception - in - parameterized - junit - test - using - array - parameter / 44522988
Don ' t build with Oracle JDK 7 on Travis anymore \n Travis switched from Ubuntu Precise images to Ubuntu Trusty images . The \n Trusty images don ' t have installed Oracle JDK 7 . See \n travis - ci / travis - ci # 7884 We still build JUnit 4 with OpenJDK 7 . \n Therefore it is fine to not build it with Oracle JDK 7 .
Improve test for assumption in Parameters method \n Improve readability by using more descriptive names . Split single test \n into two so that the two parts can fail independently . This makes it \n easier to find mistakes .
Add assumption support to Javadoc of Parameterized \n Since 7111b9621997f6c660687b8ac04003398343ee3a we support assumptions in \n @ Parameters methods . This commit adds a description of this feature to \n the Javadoc of the Parameterized runner so that people can discover the \n new feature more easily .
Set visibility of method " tryDelete " to private \n Ensure that we can change the methods signature in the future . This is \n only possible if no JUnit user can override it . Private methods cannot \n be overridden .
Add description for pull request # 876 \n We missed to add it before we released JUnit 4 . 12 . I think it may be \n still helpful when someone reads the old release notes .
Improve tests with AssumptionViolatedExceptions \n The expectations that the test are failing and not being skipped is now \n explicit .
Add test for handling InitializationError \n The code was changed by commit 0804ef4cd09b0e94783a9882c60914e22fca5108 \n but unfortunately the test was not part of the commit . The test is based \n on Philip Graf ' s test in pull request # 1065 . \n Co - authored - by : Philip Graf < git @ acanda . ch >
Support building JUnit on JDK 9 \n Developers with a current JDK 9 on their machines are currently not able \n to easily build JUnit . This commit makes it possible to develop with \n JDK 9 and ensures that JUnit can be build with JDK 0 .
Identify reflection package jdk . internal . reflect \n JDK 9 uses classes from the package jdk . internal . reflect instead of \n sun . reflect .
Replace tabs with spaces \n Use same coding style within TestClassTest .
Add explicit type parameters for JDK 5 \n The code did not compile with JDK 5 before .
Test that not annotated methods are ignored \n Make the test less fragile . The number of annotated methods varies \n because Java 9 introduces new annotations for some methods of Object .
Compare order of methods explicitly \n Make the test providesAnnotatedMethodsSortedByName less fragile . ( Before \n the test failed on JDK 9 because Java 9 introduces new annotations for \n some methods of Object . )
Recommend to set order for ExpectedException \n A test that should fail because of ErrorCollector may not fail when this \n test throws an exception that is expected by ExpectedException . \n Fixes # 1466 .
Download dependencies with JDK 8 \n As of June 18th 2018 , Maven Central supports TLS 1 . 2 only . Therefore we \n cannot install dependencies with JDK 6 anymore . As a workaround we \n switch in each build temporarily to JDK 8 for downloading the \n dependencies . Afterwards we restore the desired JDK and build System \n Rules with it .
Fix link to JUnit Toolbox \n This project moved from Google Code to GitHub . \n Fixes # 1540 .
Delete unnecessary semicolons \n These semicolons are the source of distracting warnings in the IDE .
Improve expressiveness of test name \n The test name " beforesAndAftersAreEnclosedByRule " reflects the purpose \n of the test better than " methodBeforesAndAfters " .
Check that newFolder fails for read only parent
Improve message if file exists instead of folder \n When TemporaryFolder ( String path ) or TemporaryFolder ( String . . . paths ) is \n called with a path that matches the path of an existing file then an \n IOException with a message like " a file with path < path > exists " is \n thrown .
Restore that fields shadow fields from super class \n This commit restores the shadowing behaviour of JUnit 4 . 12 . Some users \n of JUnit 4 have tests that rely on this behaviour . Their tests would \n fail with JUnit 4 . 13 . \n This commit finally reverts 39b8a92d24e6c81e4fc614cdf13003ce17bbc166 . \n Some parts have already been reverted by \n ed6813d3bbe2da4d67892f73e641fa80ab4d126e .
Deprecate Assert # assertThat \n The method " assertThat " is used for writing assertions with Hamcrest . \n Hamcrest is an independent assertion library and contains an own \n " assertThat " method in the class " org . hamcrest . MatcherAssert " . It is \n available both in the old Hamcrest 1 . 3 release and in the current \n Hamcrest 2 . 1 . Therefore the JUnit team recommends to use Hamcrest ' s own \n " assertThat " directly .
Run tests on Ubuntu Trusty \n Trusty has support for OpenJDK 6 and other old JDKs .
Add sub headlines to class Javadoc \n Structure the Javadoc .
Use separate line for annotation in Javadoc \n Align coding style of the examples .
Add a link to assertThrows in exception testing \n Provide information about alternatives to the expected parameter which \n can be used to overcome the limitations of expected . \n This is an improvement for JUnit 4 . 13 to the fix for # 806 \n ( 84dcb64cf07eba08fd7ef4de3a6aaf21f4944157 ) .
Add " Deprecate Assert # assertThat " \n We forgot to add this changes to the release notes . \n Fixes # 1645 .
Use Google ' s Maven Central mirror \n We are using Maven 3 . 1 . 1 which by default uses HTTP instead of HTTPS for \n resolving artifacts from Maven Central . Maven Central recently \n discontinued HTTP support . Therefore the build on Travis started \n failing . By using an HTTPS mirror of Maven Central the build on Travis \n will work again . \n I chose Google ' s mirror because Travis uses this mirror by default , too . \n I did not upgrade to a new version of Maven because there is no newer \n version with Java 5 support and it should be possible to build JUnit 4 \n with Java 5 so that we can easily ensure that it works with Java 5 .

Use predefined HttpResponseStatus constant instead of hardcoded 101 code \n Motivation : \n # 7269 removed an unnecessary instanciation for verifying WebSocket \n handshake status code . \n But it uses a hardcoded status code value for 101 instead of using the \n intended ` HttpResponseStatus # SWITCHING _ PROTOCOLS ` constant . \n Modidication : \n Compare actual ` HttpResponseStatus ` against predefined constant . Note \n that ` HttpResponseStatus # equals ` is implemented in respect with the RFC \n ( only honor code , not text ) so it’s intended to be used this way . \n Result : \n Cleaner code , use intended constant instead of hard coded value .
Fix ServerCookieEncoder javadoc , close # 7115 \n Motivation : \n ServerCookieEncoder’s javadoc contains some invalid copy - pasting from \n ClientCookieEncoder . \n Modifications : \n * As per RFC6265 , multiple cookies are sent as separate Set - Cookie \n response headers . \n * Fix code sample \n Result : \n Proper javadoc
Add full JdkSslContext public constructor , close # 8384 ( # 8389 ) \n Motivation : \n JdkSslContext provides public constructors to wrap an existing ` javax . net . ssl . SSLContext ` . \n Sadly , some options combinations are not possible with the existing constructors , eg : \n * protocols is not exposed and always forced to null , so default protocols are always enforced \n * startTls is not exposed and always forced to false \n Modification : \n Add full constructor that take protocols and startTls parameters . \n Result : \n It ' s possible to create a JdkSslContext from an existing SSLContext and still have control over protocols and startTls
Fix NPE when trying to build a DnsNameResolver with a null resolvedAddressTypes ( # 8445 ) \n Motivation : \n It should be possible to build a DnsNameResolver with a null resolvedAddressTypes , defaulting then to DEFAULT _ RESOLVE _ ADDRESS _ TYPES ( see line 309 ) . \n Sadly , ` preferredAddressType ` is then called on line 377 with the original parameter instead of the instance attribute , causing an NPE when it ' s null . \n Modification : \n Call preferredAddressType with instance attribuet instead of constructor parameter . \n Result : \n No more NPE
HttpUtil # is100ContinueExpected clean up ( # 8740 ) \n Motivation : \n Current implementation extract header value as String . We have an idiomatic way for checking presence of a header value . \n Modification : \n Use HttpHeaders # contains for checking if if contains Expect : 100 - continue . \n Result : \n Use idiomatic way + simplify boolean logic .
Don ' t filter out TLS _ ECDHE _ RSA _ WITH _ AES _ 256 _ GCM _ SHA384 ( # 9274 ) \n Motivation : \n TLS _ ECDHE _ RSA _ WITH _ AES _ 256 _ GCM _ SHA384 is supported since Java 8 ( see https : / / docs . oracle . com / javase / 8 / docs / technotes / guides / security / SunProviders . html ) and belongs to the recommended configurations in many references , eg SSLabs ( https : / / github . com / ssllabs / research / wiki / SSL - and - TLS - Deployment - Best - Practices ) or Google Cloud Platform Restricted Profile . \n Modifications : \n Add TLS _ ECDHE _ RSA _ WITH _ AES _ 256 _ GCM _ SHA384 to default ciphers list . \n Result : \n TLS _ ECDHE _ RSA _ WITH _ AES _ 256 _ GCM _ SHA384 is enabled by default .
Add some HTTP header constants ( # 10127 ) \n Motivation : \n Add some missing HTTP header names and values constants . \n Modification : \n * names : \n * dnt ( Do Not Track ) \n * upgrade - insecure - requests \n * x - requested - with \n * values : \n * application / xhtml + xml \n * application / xml \n * text / css \n * text / html \n * text / event - stream \n * XmlHttpRequest \n Result : \n More constants available

Only use a property where multiple entries need syncing \n * The hamcrest version is only used in one place , i . e . the dependency . \n * Using properties to define dependency versions can cause issues for others . \n * Using properties to define a shared version across multiple dependencies causes less issues \n when you have multiple dependencies that need to be kept in sync . \n * We only have one dependency here and it doesn ' t need syncing to any other dependency \n * Therefore the right thing is to just specify the version in the dependency \n * End users can still override the dependency in their poms .
Make the release plugin generate tags according to JUnit convention \n * JUnit has been using r4 . xx as the tag format \n * Maven Release Plugin would , by default , use junit - 4 . xx as the tag format \n * Maven has no strong opinion on the tag , just providing a sensible default \n * The Maven way is to follow convention , JUnit has the precident convention with existing tags
GPG signature should be generated prior to ' install ' phase . \n * There can be issues for the local repository if the signature happens after the install \n to local repository cache . \n * Only people with the GPG key should be running with the ' junit - release ' profile active \n * Therefore safer to move the execution to the ' verify ' phase
Allow tweaking release arguments form the CLI \n * We need to provide a default empty value for the ' arguments ' property within the pom \n This ensures that when the property is not provided , the build can still continue \n * The ` arguments ` property is especially useful if you don ' t have the GPG key for \n signing as you can then test the release process by adding \n - Darguments = - Dgpg . skip = true \n to the command line used to prototype a release and the verification build will succeed .
Actually allow forkers to sign their own releases \n * If you run an internal repo , you may be required to have signed artifacts \n So to make their life easier , use a property to define the default signing key \n Allows for others to swap in the key they use via the - Darguments = - Dgpg . keyname = \n trick
Move javadoc : jar and source : jar to the release profile . \n * Only need to be generated when cutting a release or deploying a - SNAPSHOT remotely \n * In those remote deploy situations - Pjunit - release will be active anyway \n * Moving them out of the main build speeds up development for all
Move the generating documentation to a separate profile \n * Given that this profile is for a specific purpose it does not need to be namespaced \n * The release profile needs namespacing as it is used from settings . xml also which \n is cross project . There should be nobody using a profile called generate - docs to \n activate their release GPG credentials

CLJ - 1161 : Remove version . properties from ' sources ' JAR \n The normal Clojure JAR contains a version . properties file with the \n correct version number filled in during the build . Before this patch , \n the ' - sources ' JAR also included a version . properties file in its raw \n form . IDEs and other tools which include the ' - sources ' JAR on the \n classpath can prevent Clojure from starting . \n This patch filters the version . properties file out of the ' - sources ' \n JAR . \n Signed - off - by : Stuart Halloway < stu @ thinkrelevance . com >

Change index removal reason when IndicesService is stopping ( # 65816 ) \n When IndicesService is stopping on a data node , it closes every \n IndexService instances that are existing by calling the \n removeIndex ( Index , IndexRemovalReason , String ) method . \n The IndexRemovalReason that is passed as a parameter in this \n case is NO _ LONGER _ ASSIGNED which is also the one passed \n in other situation like removing an index because it got assigned \n to another data node . The fact that the same reason is used in \n multiple cases make it difficult for IndexEventListener to do the \n distinction between an index closed because the node is \n shutting down and an index closed between it moved away . \n This commit changes the IndexRemovalReason used when \n closing the IndicesService to be SHUTDOWN .

Add assertion message when decrementing cache file ( # 67561 )
Relax CacheFile . decrementRefCount ( ) assertion ( # 67633 ) \n Some searchable snapshots related tests failed recently on CI for \n Windows platforms ( # 67579 ) with the following assertion tripping : \n java . lang . AssertionError : fully released cache file should be \n deleted from disk but got [ released = true , evicted = true , file not exists = false ] \n at _ _ randomizedtesting . SeedInfo . seed ( [ F459F30E820622D8 ] : 0 ) \n at org . elasticsearch . index . store . cache . CacheFile . assertRefCounted ( CacheFile . java : 244 ) \n at org . elasticsearch . index . store . cache . CacheFile . decrementRefCount ( CacheFile . java : 238 ) \n In # 67561 we improved the description of the assertion to show \n more information about the released / evicted / file status . It confirms \n that Files . notExists ( file ) sometimes returns false on Windows \n platforms . The assertion never tripped on non - Windows platforms \n so far . \n The false value does not necessary means that the file exists ; this \n value is also returned when the JVM cannot determine the status \n of the file . Since some cache files are evicted soon after the parent ' s \n directory is deleted ( shard was removed from disk ) it seems that on \n Windows it is not possible to be sure of the file non - existence . \n I think it ' s simpler to check if the file exists and fails if it ' s true . \n Close # 67633
Remove unnecessary code when reading CacheFile ( # 67654 ) \n This commit removes codes that has been introduced when Lucene \n was upgraded to 8 . 6 . 0 , in which BufferedIndexInput read method \n was changed to use a ByteBuffer instead of a fixed buffer . \n The range to read here is computed from the ByteBuffer position \n and remaining bytes so it should never exceed the ByteBuffer ' s \n remaining bytes . Also , Lucene guarantees that the ByteBuffer \n never read more bytes than the file total length so I think we \n can safely remove this unnecessary code .

Always read footer checksum from FileInfo ( # 69415 ) \n Searchable snapshots IndexInput implementations detect \n read operations that are executed on the last 16 bytes of \n files which contain the footer checksum , and then serves \n them from memory ( FileInfo ) instead of relying on cache \n mechanisms . \n But the current implementation expect an exact checksum \n read : ie a read operation that starts at file length - 16 bytes \n and expects to read exactly 16 bytes . This is not always the \n case as IndexInput implementations extend \n BufferedIndexInput which uses an internal buffer of 1024 \n bytes : in some case the remaining length ( ie , the last portion \n of the file ) might be less than 16 bytes long and thus a very \n small read is engaged using cache ( or direct ) read where it \n could instead be also served from memory .

Add resilience in TokenAuthIntegTests ( # 64757 ) \n The testExpiredTokensDeletedAfterExpiration method assumed that \n invalidating a refresh token immediately after the delete task was run \n would behave as if the token did not exist . \n However , the Elasticsearch concurrency controls do not guarantee that \n behaviour . It is possible for the request that searches for the token \n document the corresponds to the refresh token to find an invalidated \n but not yet deleted document which is reflected in the API response . \n This change makes the test resilient to this behaviour by wrapping the \n assertion in an assertBusy \n Resolves : # 56903
Update version constants in DataStreams BWC Test ( # 66316 ) \n This change updates version constants in ` FullClusterRestartIT ` to \n reflect the fact that # 65205 was backported to v7 . 11 ( as # 66307 )
Skip netty4 yaml test in FIPS mode ( # 66842 ) \n The " Netty loaded " YAML test asserts that the configured transport is \n " netty4 " , however when in FIPS mode , the tests enable security and the \n configured transport is " security4 " . \n This change skips the netty4 yaml test when running in FIPS mode . \n Resolves : # 66818
Fix string replacement in certutil http test ( # 69319 ) \n This test had 2 issues : \n 1 . It performed a replacement using a string literal on a randomly \n generated string . It is possible that the filename had " . csr " \n somewhere in the basename , which would then produce incorrect results \n 2 . It used the wrong base file for the substitution ( key vs csr ) . \n This fixes the bug by using an index based replacement rather than a \n textual one . \n Resolves : # 67328
EventEmitter : Replace ` listeners ( ) ` with ` listenerCount ( ) ` \n Summary : \n Replaces the ` listeners ( ) ` method on ` EventEmitter ` with a ` listenerCount ( ) ` method . \n Changelog : \n [ General ] [ Removed ] - Removed ` listeners ( ) ` from ` DeviceEventEmitter ` and ` NativeEventEmitter ` . \n [ General ] [ Added ] - Added ` listenerCount ( ) ` to ` DeviceEventEmitter ` and ` NativeEventEmitter ` . \n Reviewed By : cpojer \n Differential Revision : D22204156 \n fbshipit - source - id : 15029525aeef55de9934a4f319910e666ecbe1d8

Pressability : Support Lazy Hook Initialization \n Summary : \n Changes ` usePressability ` so that it accepts a nullable ` config ` argument . \n This makes it possible for a component to use ` usePressability ` and lazily allocate the ` config ` and subsequent instance of ` Pressability ` . This can be useful for components that are commonly allocated but seldom pressed because it lets many usages of ` usePressability ` avoid allocating many extraneous objects . \n Changelog : \n [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : kacieb \n Differential Revision : D23708206 \n fbshipit - source - id : 4a5063067131ce8c957fb16c49a2045e8c0b19fa
Pressability : Consistently Fire ` onPress { In , Out } ` w / o ` onPress ` \n Summary : \n Currently any component using ` Pressability ` is quickly tapped and released ( i . e . responder grant followed only by reponder release ) , we fire ` onPressIn ` and ` onPressOut ` immediately to ensure that any visual feedback for the interactive element is momentarily visible . \n Currently , we were mistakenly skipping this logic if ` onPress ` was null . \n This fixes it so that we fire ` onPressIn ` and ` onPressOut ` consistently , even if ` onPress ` is null . \n Changelog : \n [ General ] [ Fixed ] - Pressability now consistently fires ` onPressIn ` and ` onPressOut ` , even without an ` onPress ` . \n Reviewed By : lunaleaps \n Differential Revision : D23613254 \n fbshipit - source - id : e316707cbb2a4814262dea4eb1ddf6e3780268d1
Pressable : Add ` unstable _ pressDelay ` Prop \n Summary : \n Adds a new ` unstable _ pressDelay ` prop to ` Pressable ` . \n This is intended to be used to experiment with adding a delay for when ` onPressIn ` fires . The intended purpose of this delay is to prevent ` Pressable ` elements from activating ( i . e . ` onPressIn ` firing ) if a touch gesture is immediately canceled by an enclosing native component ( e . g . ` ScrollView ` ) . \n Changelog : \n [ General ] [ Added ] - Added ` unstable _ pressDelay ` prop to ` Pressable ` . \n Reviewed By : lunaleaps \n Differential Revision : D23604581 \n fbshipit - source - id : 5ce5d15a996c8a7aabaa465aa02fa8bad1044227

In the meantime , this warning is not actionable for developers who are using these frameworks . Their workarounds are to 1 ) deal with the noise in their logs , or 2 ) suppress the warning . \n Changelog : \n [ General ] [ Removed ] - Removed warning on Android for ` setTimeout ` with delays greater than 1 minute . \n Reviewed By : lunaleaps \n Differential Revision : D24964958 \n fbshipit - source - id : 1b40c8ba95d554c29dec74477aa63ea3ef8e4768

RN : Add ` NativeComponentRegistry . getWithFallback _ DEPRECATED ` \n Summary : \n Creates ` NativeComponentRegistry . getWithFallback _ DEPRECATED ` . This is deprecated from inception because it exists only to support a pattern that should not be necessary . \n For any given ` NativeX ` component , the JavaScript module that calls ` NativeComponentRegistry . get ( ' NativeX ' , … ) ` should only exist in the JavaScript bundle if the native binary actually supports that native component . \n But in today ' s transitional state of the world , there are JavaScript modules that use ` UIManager . getViewManagerConfig ( ' NativeX ' ) ` as a means of feature detection . \n The purpose of ` NativeComponentRegistry . getWithFallback _ DEPRECATED ` is to bridge this transitional gap . Component should migrate toward initializing the ` NativeComponentRegistry ` with a runtime configuration provider that enumerates all supported native components . If the native component is not supported , it should return null . \n Changelog : \n [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : fkgozali \n Differential Revision : D25109988 \n fbshipit - source - id : 76f7077904594ca63495d8338905c43712ea02e0

RN : Remove ` RCTDeviceEventEmitter ` Checks \n Summary : \n Removes the checks in ` RCTDeviceEventEmitter ` that were initially added to migrate call sites to other modules when ` NativeEventEmitter ` was introduced . \n This set of checks is problematic for a few reasons : \n 1 . Does not cover many other events that have since been introduced , so the small list covered is arbitrary . \n 2 . Prevents composition of ` RCTDeviceEventEmitter ` in the implementation of those modules . \n 3 .

Reduce memory requirements for MockWebServerTest . disconnectHalfway ( ) . \n MockWebServer . readRequest ( ) was accumulating the request body ( 1 GByte ) \n into an unbounded buffer held in memory . This caused the test to fail \n with an OutOfMemoryError on low - memory devices . Due to the OOME , not \n even a stacktrace was available . \n This CL introduces setBodyLimit ( ) to limit the amount of data held in \n memory . Note that this is similar to the call to setBodyLimit ( 0 ) that \n already exists in URLConnectionTest . veryLargeFixedLengthRequest ( ) .
Let SocksProxy use the same definition of localhost as MockWebServer . \n This fixes SocksProxyTest failing on some systems . The problem was that \n MockWebServer is listening on InetAddress . getByName ( " localhost " ) but \n SocksProxy was trying to connect to InetAddress . getLoopbackAddress ( ) . \n This is not guaranteed to work , for example on recent AOSP , " localhost " \n resolves to 127 . 0 . 0 . 1 but getLoopbackAddress ( ) is : : 1 ( IPv6 ) . \n This CL makes the simplest change to make the two consistent so that \n SocksProxyTest passes . In the long run , OkHttp may want to consider \n using getLoopbackAddress ( ) . getHostname ( ) everywhere instead of hard \n coding the hostname " localhost " at all .
Cleanup refactoring : Move 3 methods into DelegatingHttpsURLConnection \n These three methods were delegating to delegate ; their implementation \n was duplicated across both subclasses of DelegatingHttpsURLConnection . \n This change moves them into the base class in order to \n - avoid duplication \n - separate the responsibility of delegation ( base class ) from the \n responsibility of change to behavior ( subclasses ) . \n Notes : \n - Since these three methods are not available in Java 6 , each of \n these need a @ IgnoreJRERequirement annotation to pass the \n animal sniffer test . This appears like it should have been \n necessary before but for some reason it used to pass without . \n - This in turn requires a new dependency from okhttp - urlconnection \n onto animal - sniffer - annotations . The dependency was added onto \n version 1 . 11 of that library ( consistent with okhttp itself ) ; \n okio depends on version 1 . 10 , the latest version is 1 . 15 .
Allow HTAB in header values . \n RFC 7230 section 3 . 2 allows HTAB ( ' \ t ' , ' \ u0009 ' ) inside header \n values as long as there is not more than one in a row : \n https : / / tools . ietf . org / html / rfc7230 # section - 3 . 2 \n Before this CL , OkHttp previously disallowed HTAB in header values . \n This CL changes behavior to allow any number of consecutive HTABs \n inside a header value ; this is more permissive than the RFC , but \n is consistent with how OkHttp currently treats space characters \n ( ' ' , ' \ u0020 ' ) .
HUC regression test : disconnect in the middle of connecting . \n Prior to commit 084b06b48bae2b566bb1be3415b6c847d8ea3682 ( OkHttp 3 . 4 . 0 ) , \n a HttpURLConnection . disconnect ( ) in the middle of connecting caused an \n infinite loop . HUC does not claim to be thread safe , but concurrent \n disconnect should generally be supported ( it is supported by HttpEngine ) \n and this bug occurred even when the disconnect ( ) happened in the same \n thread , e . g . through the CookieJar . \n The infinite loop prior to that CL occurred because \n - The loop in HttpURLConnectionImpl . java : 418 did not check for the \n disconnected state , \n - { StreamAllocation , RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor } . recover ( ) returns \n true for canceled StreamAllocations / calls , but \n StreamAllocation . newStream ( ) immediately fails if already canceled . \n This bug was specific to HUC and did not affect the Call API because \n RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor ' s ( and , in earlier OkHttp versions , \n Call . getResponse ( ) ' s ) infinite loop did check the canceled case \n before proceeding . \n The bug existed since at least OkHttp 2 . 7 . 5 , likely introduced by \n commit c358656c8799d30fd422448153e99a5dd37e298a ( OkHttp 2 . 7 . 0 ) . \n The new test asserts that a disconnect ( ) while constructing the \n cookie headers leads to the new connection being aborted . It would \n also be permissible for the connection to succeed ( as long as it \n doesn ' t deadlock like it used to ) , but the stricter test seems \n reasonable to ensure that any behavior change is deliberate . \n A disconnect ( ) while accessing the Cache FileSystem has the same \n effect , but this is not covered by the added test because a \n new FileSystem wrapper class that delegates all calls would \n create code maintenance overhead .
OkHttpsURLConnection . setSSLSocketFactory ( null ) : throw . \n OkHttpsURLConnection extends javax . net . ssl . HttpsURLConnection . \n The super class documentation says that setSSLSocketFactory ( null ) \n throws IllegalArgumentException , but this implementation didn ' t \n do that . \n This CL fixed OkHttpsURLConnection . setSSLSocketFactory ( null ) to \n throw , as specified . \n Test : not done locally , relying on Travis .

Specify encoding for Base64Coder . encodeString ( ) , as the rest of GDX does ( # 6061 ) \n * Specify encoding for Base64Coder . encodeString ( ) , as the rest of GDX does \n This commit also adds Javadocs where they were missing for one encodeString ( ) and makes the spelling of " Base64 " consistently " Base64 " and not sometimes " Base 64 " . \n * Add line to CHANGES for # 6061
Update AGP version to avoid warning , also gdx - ai
Also update Ashley and Box2D Lights ( all extensions with versions )
CHANGES : mention the big security fix , small Json add , minor API nicety
Correct IntFloatMap . getAndIncrement ( ) parameter types \n This was a copy - paste error ; it was found by Raymond Buckley trying to use 1 . 9 . 11 - SNAPSHOT with Typing - Label ( which doesn ' t build with the snapshot right now ) .
Two - line fix for # 4489 ( DelaunayTriangulator bug ) ( # 6177 ) \n * Fix to # 4489 , requesting review re : sorting and / or geometry \n Tested against the issue in the meantime
Set removed values in IntMap / LongMap to null \n This fixes # 6285 . It makes IntMap and LongMap act how ObjectMap already does . Only the remove ( ) methods on IntMap , LongMap , and their MapIterator inner classes are changed .
If a font lacks ' x ' , fall back to Arial and place a note . ( # 6360 ) \n The note can be easily removed just by pressing the ASCII , NeHe , or Extended buttons , but it lets the user know why Arial was selected instead of some emoji - only font or something .
Fix getIndices ( ) crash in Mesh ( # 6390 ) \n Fix getIndices ( ) crash in Mesh , credit to Agueliethun \n This was a copy / paste error from the Buffer casts change recently . The getIndices ( ) code mistakenly changed the vertices buffer where it formerly changed only the indices buffer . This caused crashes in ModelCacheTest when the Cache checkbox was selected and any model was added .
Decal Material binds to texture unit 0 , closes # 4024
Revert " Fixes # 4322 : Restore window on correct monitor " ( # 4324 )
Add exclusion of robovm . xml for fat jars \n Adds an exclusion of robovm . xml for the android sub project to avoid conflicts due to the android gradle plugin and non platform specific dependencies that support robovm .
Allow apk expansion to be used with fragments also . Fixes # 4787
Prevent nesting of beginCache and begin , fixes # 4781
Check for 0 indices before attempting to set on copy . Fixes # 4775
Eliminate allocs - Legend arrays ( # 1892 ) \n In addition to creating a resized label sizes array , copy old FSize instances to the new array to cut down on the need to get instances from pool . Recycle to pool if the labels shrank .
Eliminate allocs - Cache XBounds in Renderer ( # 1892 ) \n getXBounds creates a disposable XBounds instance on every call . Cache it and update the values with a set method . This means XBounds values are now mutable .
Eliminate allocs - Buffer Paint . FontMetrics ( # 1892 ) \n paint . getFontMetrics ( ) has a hidden allocation . paint . getFontMetrics ( fontMetrics ) is used internally inside of Paint , so caching and holding onto a metrics buffer helps reduce allocations .
Eliminate allocs - XAxisRender array ( # 1892 ) \n Found an array that was instantiated frequently without need . Placed bounds on its instantiation .
Update DevSite API to v1 . 17 \n Updated DevSite API to new a fresh JAR , built against Google API client \n v1 . 17 . 0 - rc . \n Also updated project dependencies so that only API client v1 . 17 . + will \n be used , to prevent future breakage .
Add README file \n Cloned text from old project page at http : / / code . google . com / p / iosched .

Update Travis CI configuration \n - Include SDK v20 for Wear support . \n - Switch to build tools v20 .
Add debug keystore \n A keystore needs to be present in order to enable continuous integration \n builds . This is standard Android debug keystore with a 100 year \n validity .
Update proguard config to exclude test classes \n Reference to classes in test frameworks ( e . g . JUnit ) were causing \n Proguard to fail while running the ' build ' task .
Update scripts for CI server integration \n Update scripts / wait _ for _ emulator . sh to use a 60 second delay , with 10 \n seconds between checks . The old version only waited 3 seconds , which \n was not long enough for the emulator to startup . \n Also updated Android SDK dependencies in . travis . yml to use Google API \n packages .

Fabric : Telemetry time point serialization functions \n Summary : \n Fabric ' s Telemetry uses ` std : : chrono : : steady _ clock : : time _ point ` s to represent the exact moments in time when some events happen . This is the same clock that pretty much any performance tracker use ( and should use ) , QPL included . \n However , different trackers use different serializable representations of that timepoints .

Fabric : Introducing ` YogaLayoutableKindMutatesStylesAfterCloning ` trait \n Summary : \n This implements a new ShadowNode trait that helps to propagate Yoga node ` isDirty ` flag down the root of the tree and clone siblings appropriately . \n Several Fabric components mutate its Yoga styles after the node was cloned . In such cases , we need to mark the node as dirty after doing so . The problem with this is that the parent node and its siblings were already updated ( cloned or not ) based on the previous value of the ` isDirty ` flag . This happens because this logic is implemented in YogaLayoutableShadowNode which is a base constructor that must be called before any other logic from a subclass can run . \n For now , this change enables that for SafeAreaView only ( which seems to help with some junkiness issues ) , later we can extend the usage of this for other components if needed . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] Fabric - specific internal change . \n Reviewed By : JoshuaGross \n Differential Revision : D24719347 \n fbshipit - source - id : b0d050afea5de9c470e05e1b4c9e7052e00ae949

Using ` YGPositionTypeAbsolute ` value where we compare ` absolute ` vs ` relative ` \n Summary : \n Now Yoga . cpp does not use the ` YGPositionTypeRelative ` value / constant , it uses ` YGPositionTypeAbsolute ` instead . \n Now ` YGPositionType ` can only be ` YGPositionTypeRelative ` or ` YGPositionTypeAbsolute ` , so expressions ` x = = YGPositionTypeRelative ` and ` x ! = YGPositionTypeAbsolute ` are equivalent . \n The reasoning behind the change is that in all cases we actually check a node to be ( or not to be ) ` absolute ` , not ` relative ` . This will make a difference in the coming diffs in the stack when we will introduce a new value for the type : ` static ` . \n We need to differentiate ` static ` and ` relative ` values t implement the ` stacking context ` feature in the W3C - compliant way ( to fix bugs and avoid developer confusion ) .

Fabric : Using pre - cached UIColor objects for black , white , and clear colors \n Summary : \n This change maps the three most used colors ( black , white , clear ) to corresponding predefined values in UIColor .

And . . . it no much at least in terms of kilobytes . However , I still think it ' s a good idea to implement this because I hope that can remove some work from memory allocation infra and maybe enable some optimizations that UIKit hopefully does for black and white colors .

TextInput measuring error in ScrollResponder downgraded to a warning \n Summary : \n Even though replacing an error with a warning does not look like a future - proof solution here are the reasons for this : \n * The measuring operation might just fail because of the async nature of React Native . And here , from my understanding , we don ' t even have a good reason for measuring . Auto - scrolling to selected textinput ( which is the reason for this code , AFAIK ) is a standard feature that OS does for all text input . I suspect that this ( very old ) feature was built in a timeframe where this system feature was originally broken ( sometime before 2016 ) . \n * This product - facing API does not have an error - callback , so just loggin an error here is as ( not ) actionable as logging a warning . \n * The error callback was never implemented in the pre - Fabric world , so it * never * got called for years , and now when Fabric is starting calling in some cases , it is being " punished " for this .

Fabric : Fixes in Android TextLayoutManager for better caching performance \n Summary : \n The is how it works : \n * Text is a quite special component with special properties and constraints . Some of them are : \n It ' s expensive to measure ( layout ) text . It ' s expensive to measure and expensive to pass AttributedString via JNI . \n * When we measure text , we don ' t concerned about maximum height , only maximum height is important . ( Even though theoretically , there are text layout systems that can balance these constraints ( max height and width ) trying to find a perfect result , we don ' t use such complex ( and expensive ) layout engines for building UIs ) . \n Yoga , as a flexbox engine , does not aware of such constraints , so it requests remeasuring of text components quite often , so we have an RN built - in text measure cache system just for text measurements that suit these constraints . This way when Yoga requests a text measuring , we always measure with ` Inf ` height and store that result in the cache . And when Yoga requests another measure with the same width but a different height we retrieve the value from the cache and then just clamp it . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] Fabric - specific internal change . \n Reviewed By : mdvacca \n Differential Revision : D26696637 \n fbshipit - source - id : f65b275d33c77073bc2359cbf0a741ddcf05d8d4

Fix finalizing task creation condition in SourcePartitionedScheduler \n Previously , all tasks are proactively created when schedule \n is blocked on SPLIT _ QUEUES _ FULL to prevent potential deadlock in the \n presence of broadcast join . \n Such deadlock usually happens with SPLIT _ QUEUES _ FULL . \n However , it could also happen with NO _ ACTIVE _ DRIVER _ GROUP , \n when the probe side of broadcast join enables grouped execution , \n and partitions on the probe side table are small . \n So lifespan can finish split schedule without blocked by \n SPLIT _ QUEUES _ FULL . \n This is a regression introduced by 55c10010bbe97ac5de8febf59c7ef58aa4d33f95 . \n Prior to this commit , all tasks are created unconditionally . \n The fix is to finish task creation when grouped execution is enabled , \n since all tasks are created at beginning anyway in this case . \n ( assume the number of lifespans is larger than the task pool size )
Avoid exception message duplication in PageResponseHandler \n When a PageTransportErrorException is thrown , today it will be wrapped \n in another PageTransportErrorException with the original exception \n message copied . \n This is unnecessary since the original message is contained in cause . \n When the exception message is long ( e . g . it may contain stacktrace from \n the remote host ) , useful information can be omitted .

Make StageScheduler notify all tasks are scheduled \n There are three major responsibilities for ` SourcePartitionedScheduler ` : \n - Split schedule \n - Task schedule and stage management \n - Lifespan schedule \n Note ` SourcePartitionedScheduler ` can be used either as \n an ` StageScheduler ` or ` SourceScheduler ` . In both case it needs to \n take care about split schedule . \n - When it ' s used as a ` StageScheduler ` , it ' s always used for \n unpartitioned stage ( i . e . JOIN / AGGREGATE over remote source . \n - It needs to take care about task schedule \n - It doesn ' t need to take care about lifespan schedule \n - When it ' s used as a ` SourceScheduler ` , it ' s used by a \n ` FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler ` to schedule \n table scan sources . \n * It doesn ' t need to take care about task schedule \n ( although today it still do so ) \n * It need to take care about lifespan schedule \n Historically , ` FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler ` doesn ' t call \n ` stage . transitionToSchedulingSplits ( ) ` . And it relies on \n ` SourcePartitionedScheduler ` to do this stage management , \n even ` SourcePartitionedScheduler ` is used as a ` SourceScheduler ` . \n This is confusing and error - prone , as it should be ` StageScheduler ` ' s \n responsibility to do stage management . \n This commit makes ` FixedSourcePartitionedScheduler ` to call \n ` stage . transitionToSchedulingSplits ( ) ` . As a result , it release the \n needs for ` SourcePartitionedScheduler ` from doing this for \n grouped execution ( in the context of grouped execution , \n ` SourcePartitionedScheduler ` is guaranteed to be used as an \n ` SourceScheduler ` ) . \n In principle , ` SourcePartitionedScheduler ` doesn ' t need to do stage \n management at all as long as it ' s used as a ` SourceScheduler ` ( even for \n ungrouped execution ) . This is not done in this commit . \n ` FixedCountScheduler ` doesn ' t need to call \n ` stage . transitionToSchedulingSplits ( ) ` since it there will be no table \n splits to schedule .

Disable bucket filter with compatible bucketing read \n Unnecessary remote exchange between compatible bucketing \n in 57c70aee95fe6c00666f13ba5dc2f930fae87d84 ( compatible bucketing \n refers to when Hive tables have same bucketing key , and bucket numbers \n are different but compatible ) . \n To remove unnecessary remote exchange , the concept of ` readBucketNumber ` , \n which might be different from ` tableBucketNumber ` was introduced . This \n number indicates the logical bucket number from engine ' s perspective . \n After the change ` $ bucket ` column respects ` readBucketNumber ` instead of \n ` tableBucketNumber ` , this can cause correctness issues , as described in \n https : / / github . com / prestodb / presto / issues / 12329 . \n This commit disable bucket filter with compatible bucketing read to \n avoid correctness problem . To fix the root cause , we should make \n ` $ bucket ` respect ` tableBucketNumber ` .

Allow insert overwrite as default behavior for Hive connector \n Hive connector users often expects INSERT OVERWRITE as the default \n INSERT behavior .

Update Guava to 15 . 0 \n We want to integrate Parceler , but we ran into a problem . The Guava \n version used by Parceler is 15 . 0 , but our pom is declaring the 13 . 0 . 1 \n version . Because of this when using Parceler in conjunction with AA , \n the older Guava dependency is resolved , witch results in problems , \n since Parceler needs the new classes introduced since 13 . 0 . 1 . \n This commit addresses this issue by simply updating the Guava version to \n 15 . 0 . This is enough because our code do not uses any classes which are \n changed since 13 . 0 . 1 .

Move Checkstyle execution to a separate profile for Travis \n It can be really annoying for contributors for always fixing the code \n due to broken build by Checkstyle even before starting implementing a \n feature . That ' s why the Checkstyle execution is moved to a separate \n profile what will be used by Travis CI . Contributors are still \n encouraged to run Checkstyle manually before pushing code , but Travis \n will reject malformatted code in the PRs anyway .

Re - add Eclipse APT settings \n We are using a special Eclipse plugin to enable hot swapping and JRebel \n of the processor , this cannot be generated by m2e - apt , so \n unfortunetaly we have to store these Eclipse preferences in the \n repository .
Allow abstract @ EApplication not registered in the manifest
Remove @ RunWith from HasOtherAnnotations \n This annotation makes some JUnit runners think this class is a test \n case , and fail to test . We already test this kind of annotation with \n @ TestTargetClass .
Move back AndroidManifest . xml to root \n This way we can configure Eclipse without m2e - apt , which cannot handle \n Eclipse plugin processors .
Commit functional test JDT Eclipse prefs \n Unfortunetaly this file is needed because annotation processing is \n turned off in Eclipse by default . However , m2e will update this file \n when the project is imported . This makes working with git inconvenient , \n since we always have to stash the file when changing branching etc . So \n we just commit the whole file now , since it does not really make a \n difference since the file is already present in the repository .

Do not extract annotations on Android classes \n Currently there is a serious bug [ 1 ] in the Android Support library , \n which is causing processing to fail when extracting annotations from \n ancestor classes . The library was compiled with bad options , so some \n annotations are missing from the jar . This commit is a workaround for \n the problem : we simply skip the extraction when we encounter a class \n starting with the " android " package name prefix . This workaround can be \n permanent , because this will not effect usage , and also adds a little \n optimizations , as AA annotations will not be found ever on Android \n classes . \n 1 : https : / / code . google . com / p / android / issues / detail ? id = 175086

Make ArrayAllocator implementations public \n Operators that need to use BlockFlattener need to instantiate an \n ArrayAllocator . However the ArrayAllocators were package private and \n can ' t be accessed by operators not under the root folder of operator . \n This commit makes them public .
Fix BenchmarkPartitionedOutputOperator \n OptimizedPartitionedOutputFactory # createOutputOperator ( ) now takes a new \n parameter Optional < OutputPartitioning > outputPartitioning and require it \n to be present . The change came from the " Refactor LocalExecutionPlanner " \n commit in # 14099 . This broke BenchmarkPartitionedOutputOperator because \n an empty outputPartitioning was passed in . This commit fixes the problem \n by passing in an non - empty outputPartitioning .
Do not create Slice while comparing keys in SingleMapBlock \n When seeking a key represented in Slice format , the comparison of the \n key value and the value in the SingleMapBlock at the position of the \n hashCode was done through keyBlockNativeEquals . invokeExact ( ) , which \n creates a new Slice object . When there are many map subscript operations \n in a query , many small Slice objects are created and this causes high \n GC overhead which may lead to reliability problems . This commit uses \n the newly introduced Block . equals ( int , Slice ) to do the comparison and \n it does not create the Slice objects . \n It also improves the map subscript operation on varchars by up to 30 % . \n Before : \n Benchmark ( mapSize ) ( name ) Mode Cnt Score Error Units \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 1 fix - width avgt 20 43 . 658 ± 2 . 070 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 1 var - width avgt 20 76 . 798 ± 1 . 174 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 1 dictionary avgt 20 71 . 693 ± 1 . 728 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 13 fix - width avgt 20 673 . 659 ± 35 . 320 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 13 var - width avgt 20 1549 . 805 ± 114 . 924 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 13 dictionary avgt 20 1505 . 389 ± 55 . 895 ns / op \n After : \n Benchmark ( mapSize ) ( name ) Mode Cnt Score Error Units \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 1 fix - width avgt 20 31 . 709 ± 1 . 050 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 1 var - width avgt 20 56 . 716 ± 1 . 767 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 1 dictionary avgt 20 66 . 426 ± 2 . 030 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 13 fix - width avgt 20 569 . 891 ± 21 . 386 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 13 var - width avgt 20 1061 . 052 ± 49 . 004 ns / op \n BenchmarkMapSubscript . mapSubscript 13 dictionary avgt 20 1118 . 587 ± 71 . 122 ns / op

Fix memory tracking for PartitionedOutputOperator \n Previously the PartitionedOutputOperator tracks memory after finishing \n processing the page . This could cause severe under counting when the \n pages are very large and flush every time because flush ( ) resets the \n pageBuilders . This commit reports the memory before flush ( ) which is \n more accurate . It also changes the counting from getSizeInBytes ( ) to \n getRetainedSizeInBytes ( ) because the first was under counting for 20 % .
Return arrays in reverse order of borrowing \n OptimizedPartitionedOutputOperator uses SimpleArrayAllocator to reuse \n int arrays . SimpleArrayAllocator works in stack mode that most recently \n returned array would be borrowed out first next . To avoid unnecessary \n memory allocations due by mismatch between borrow and return order , \n make sure to return arrays in reverse order of borrowing .
Fix getRetainedSizeInBytes for DecodedBlockNode \n The DecodedBlockNode # getRetainedSizeInBytes ( ) used to add up the current \n node and all of its childrens ' sizes . But the decodedBlock in current \n node already covers all children ' s decodedBlocks . This commit removes \n the double counting by removing the children ' s retained sizes from the \n sum .

Remove positionCount check in createRandomLongDecimalsBlock \n TestRowBasedSerialization sometimes fails calling \n createRandomLongDecimalsBlock with less than 10 positions . We should \n allow blocks with less than 10 positions to be created if there are \n such needs . This commit removes the check to enforce the positionCount \n check , and comments were added to suggest the user use a larger \n positinCount when desired nullRate > 0 .
Reduce positions array size in PartitionBuffer \n In OptimizedPartitionedOutputOperator , the PagePartioner has \n partitionCount number of PartitionBuffer , and each PartitionBuffer \n has a positions array to record the positions to be appended to this \n buffer . Previously this positions array was initialized to be the \n incoming page ' s positionCount size . This could waste lots of memory \n since each partition may only get a small portion of rows . This commit \n reduces the initial positions array size from positionCount to \n min ( positionCount , ( positionCount / partitionCount + 1 ) * 2 ) and \n grow it on the fly . \n JMH benchmark shows about 8 - 10 % gain in retained size : \n addPage		optimizedAddPage optimizedAddPage _ reducePositions Gain % \n bigint	 	 	335 , 715 , 874 	 424 , 471 , 312 	 	390 , 497 , 040 		 8 % \n ARRAY ( BIGINT ) 	 	327 , 680 , 906 	 294 , 847 , 046 	 	270 , 506 , 390 		 8 % \n ROW ( BIGINT , BIGINT ) 	315 , 490 , 496 	 261 , 529 , 566 	 	236 , 571 , 362 		 10 %

Reserve memory for nested BlockBuilders in projection \n In bf4bf6a610 " Reserve memory before projecting rows " we created the \n BlockBuilders new every time . However , nested BlockBuilders for complex \n types would lose the status from previously created BlockBuilders such \n that memory growth increased . For example , for an ARRAY ( BIGINT ) \n BlockBuilder , the nested LongArrayBlockBuilder would just have the same \n expectedEntries as the ArrayBlockBuilder although the entries in the \n LongArrayBlockBuilder could be a lot more . \n This commit uses the newly introduced newBlockBuilderLike ( ) method that \n estimates the expectedEntries for nested BlockBuilders from previously \n created BlockBuilders . The following simple ArrayTransform query shows \n the allocated long [ ] reduced from 118GB to 93GB on TPCH 100GB . \n select transform ( l _ array , x - > x + 1 ) from lineitem _ map _ array ;

Do not check the return value of Future . cancel ( ) \n Future . cancel ( ) is expected to return false if the future is done or had been cancelled \n previously , and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to check whether or not that is the case \n without a race condition . \n RELNOTES : None . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 339686101
Explicitly interrupt a cancelled strategy instead of relying on a misleading checkState \n Future . cancel ( ) is expected to return false if the future is done or had been \n cancelled previously - a situation that often arises in stopBranch ( ) . We therefore \n want to remove the checkState for Future . cancel ( ) ' s return value . \n However , it turned out that removing the checkState by itself would cause some \n dynamic builds to fail : if the future of the strategy calling stopBranch ( ) was \n itself cancelled but not interrupted ( a situation that sometimes arises ) , both \n branches could attempt to write outputs . The IllegalStateException thrown by \n checkState had the effect of interrupting the cancelled branch , allowing the build \n to succeed most of the time , as long as the exception got caught somewhere ( which \n it often was ) . \n We therefore want to replace the implicit effect of the misleading checkState with \n an explicit check for a cancelled strategy and an explicit interruption . \n RELNOTES : None . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 342340917

Fix the issue with classes that should only be included in the failureaccess artifact being included in the main Guava jar . \n It appears ( thanks to @ michaelhixson on https : / / github . com / google / guava / issues / 3302 ) that the issue is with the maven - bundle - plugin ( which does OSGi stuff ) . Presumably because Guava was declaring that it exports com . google . common . * ( and doesn ' t exclude com . google . common . util . concurrent . internal ) , it was pulling those class files in from the dependency . It was also pointed out by @ talios in that issue that failureaccess doesn ' t include OSGi metadata to export that package . \n This change should fix both of those issues , but we ' re going to need to release a failureaccess 1 . 0 . 1 and then guava 27 . 0 . 1 . \n RELNOTES = Fixes an issue where classes that should only be included in failureaccess ( Guava ' s one dependency ) were also being included in the main Guava jar . \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n Created by MOE : https : / / github . com / google / moe \n MOE _ MIGRATED _ REVID = 218884985

Print the actual output of failed tests . \n Luckily , last time I was able to guess at the cause specifically because it was an " error " and not a " failure . " \n And typically we ' d be able to reproduce the failure by running locally , though I ' m not sure if that ' s the case here because it depends on test ordering . . . which is currently dependent on the filesytem ' s order of files , but I ' ll deal with that in a separate CL . \n This appears to be the best solution : https : / / stackoverflow . com / a / 19685036 / 28465 \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n Created by MOE : https : / / github . com / google / moe \n MOE _ MIGRATED _ REVID = 174362932
Run tests in a deterministic order . \n We just had a failure that depends on test execution order . It wasn ' t too hard to figure out ( and would have been even easier with the output that I ' m adding in CL 174361258 ) , but determinism is a good thing that may help us in the future . \n ( It * might * also bring us closer to the Bazel test - runner behavior , but I haven ' t actually checked . And anyway , we shard some of our Bazel tests , so even if both systems now use the samer order , they might be executing different subsets of tests , so they still might not show the same errors . ) \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n Created by MOE : https : / / github . com / google / moe \n MOE _ MIGRATED _ REVID = 174365332

Annotate some flaky slow tests as @ AndroidIncompatible . \n These tests appear to have become flakier around CL 148237028 - - probably mostly because it removed @ AndroidIncompatible from one method but perhaps because of the changes in implementations of some of the other methods . ( I even wonder if changes to the implementations of some tests are causing other tests to fail , given the number of new failures I saw in unrelated tests in my " After " run .

Try out @ OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper , and remove some unnecessary work in AbstractMapTester . \n The first couple locations I found to use @ OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper were cases where we ' re already doing the right thing , so that ' s " disappointing .

So I fixed that . Maybe , if we ' re lucky , it will make our GWT and Android tests faster - - at least internally , where we actually run our suite - builder suites on those platforms .

Remove some misleading interruption docs : \n - Our interruption behavior doesn ' t fully match the JDK . My point in CL 23833126 was that both AbstractFuture and the JDK implementations throw if the thread was interrupted * before * the get ( ) call as well as during . But : \n - We differ from the JDK in a different area : We throw InterruptedException even if the get ( ) call wouldn ' t have had to wait . ( We see this as a feature : Since the task is apparently cancelled anyway , we might as well take this opportunity to abort . ) \n - My phrasing may be equally misleading in the other direction : It may suggest that get ( ) throws if the thread was * ever * interrupted in the past . More generally , by changing the phrasing at all , I may be suggesting a change in behavior where none exists . \n - InterruptedException support is probably in some sense " optional , " but there ' s no reason to call it out as specifically optional for AbstractFuture . \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n Created by MOE : https : / / github . com / google / moe \n MOE _ MIGRATED _ REVID = 155865732

Prepare to move gwt - user to test scope after we remove GWT - RPC support . \n When we do that , we ' ll no longer be able to compile ForceGuavaCompilationEntryPoint as part of the normal javac compile or build its Javadoc ( because of the " missing " dependency ) . \n ( ForceGuavaCompilationEntryPoint lives under the main ( i . e . , non - test ) sources because we want to ensure that our prod code compiles without any dependencies added by our tests . ) \n So exclude it from the javac compile , and turn off building Javadoc altogether .

Make lenientToString easier for nullness - analysis tools to understand . \n And I think prevent it from turning a StackOverflowError into a NullPointerException in unlikely cases ? \n As far as tools know , String . valueOf is capable of throwing an Error or RuntimeException , even when it ' s called with a parameter whose values is null . Thus , tools conclude that the flow of the program might reach ` o . getClass ( ) . getName ( ) ` when ` o ` is null . That would in turn produce NullPointerException . \n Tools might not even be wrong , since String . valueOf could produce a StackOverflowError if we were * just * about to run out of space . Of course , in that case we ' re going to have problems in the catch ( ) block no matter what . . . : ) \n To avoid this , we check for null in lenientToString itself . \n RELNOTES = n / a \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n Created by MOE : https : / / github . com / google / moe \n MOE _ MIGRATED _ REVID = 297360806

Reduce contention in PathExistenceCache . directoryExists ( ) / fileExists ( ) . A \n ConcurrentHashMap locks an entire shard and so with a high job count , we create \n needless contention here . As per the documentation of ConcurrentHashMap , \n the computeIfAbsent ( ) implementation needs to be fast which a file stat might \n not always be . Instead accept that we might be doing the underlying \n stat multiple times . Another alternative would be to use futures , but \n experiments suggest that the marginal reduction in stats is not worth the extra \n complexity and memory overhead . \n RELNOTES : None . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 346133029

Speed up filterListForObscuringSymlinks ( ) .

In addition , we can selectively disable . d files for \n individual inputs if the input file type isn ' t one that we use . d files for . \n RELNOTES : None . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 342589186

Reduce the number of stats performed when creating the output directories . \n The Path . createDirectoryAndParents ( ) function generally walks up the given \n output path , static for each path segment until it finds one that exists , the \n walks back down creating the directories . checkSymlinks does the same walk \n checking for symlinks along the way .

Only generate no - PIC action from a CppCompileActionTemplate when it might \n actually be needed . This is the same behavior as regular CppCompileActions \n have .

Pre - concatenate private and public modular headers .

Fix bug in CppCompileActionTemplate . The bug here is that the header compile \n action were always set to using no - PIC compiles . That doesn ' t work if we don ' t \n even generate no - PIC compiles and can lead to unexpected state wrt . modules \n being available . \n Instead , use the same logic as for regular CppCompileActions : Use PIC if PIC is \n available . \n RELNOTES : None . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 351117185

Enclosed is generally useful , and belongs in org . junit . runners
An annotated method is no longer hidden by an overloading method .
Methods on inaccessible superclasses of test classes are caught during validation
Someone doesn ' t like commas at the end of annotation lists
Need to create bin dir in build . xml for users not on Eclipse .
Ignoring the timeout test , so that gump can run . Need to fix this later .
JUnitCore can run a class with a suite ( ) method .
Eclipse thinks commas at the end of array initialization expressions are OK . Javac disagrees . Moved in favor of javac
Rename validateAllMethods to validateMethodsForDefaultRunner , which is clearer
Test handling of private suite ( ) methods
@ Ignore javadoc \n Fix TestClass method visibility \n Update build . xml to produce snapshots
Pass nullsOk into constructor ( requires further cleanup )
Added getOnlyConstructor API to TestClass , using it here
ParentRunner includes filtering - - noted that we should use it
Test that non - static data points are flagged failures
Pass nullsOk into Assignments constructor ( requires further cleanup )
Leave this method in - - it ' s used by the JMock custom runner , and possibly others
No matching parameters is now an assumption failure , not an assertion failure
Properly handles ignore notifications from inside a started / ended block
Complain if class has more than one constructor
if DataPoints annotation present on a field , and looking for Object parameter , interpret as array , not object
Don ' t need to pass instance in to calculate values
Ignored tests should be shown differently in stack trace section of report
Allow AssumptionFailedExceptions to have a simple , string based reason
Use single - arg assumptionFailureException constructor to beautify reporting
A method marked @ Theory and @ Test should only be executed once
First try at creating . releaserc for Perl release script
Can now handle any kind of Throwable thrown from FailOnTimeout
Updated documentation to include at least references for our work of the last few weeks
Re - added OldTestClassRunner and TestClassRunner , since they may have been used with @ RunWith to override JUnit default behavior in the past .
Fix reference to experimental tests in build file
Pushed down call to getParametersList to the lowest point possible
Exceptions are expensive to create if we don ' t plan to throw them ( the stack trace is always filled in )
Added assumption to TheoriesPerformanceTest , to prevent continuous integration from breaking on other boxes .
If there are no data points that pass the assumption , the test fails .
Remove Assume . fail , which is uncalled
org . junit base package all javadoc ' ed
JUnit4 runner as a pointer to the current default

Make a failure to spawn the subprocess in a sandbox exit code 36 rather than 1 . It ' s a local environmental error for the subprocess not to start , rather than a build failure , as evidenced by the other bits : Status . EXECUTION _ FAILED is a " system " error and the suggestively named LOCAL _ EXEC _ ERROR . \n I would be happy to just migrate this code to EXECUTION _ IO _ EXCEPTION and change that exit code as well . This one seems more egregiously wrong , given that it has the " system " bits set in the SpawnResult , but that one also seems bad . \n RELNOTES : Bazel returns exit code 36 ( rather than 1 ) if it fails to start a subprocess in a local sandbox due to environmental issues , for example , if the argument list is too long . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 339245633

Don ' t return null for missing values if we have a pending exception to throw in package loading : it may be our last chance if we ' re in error bubbling . \n Also don ' t unnecessarily wrap an IOException encountered during globbing : it leads to a less friendly error message since the exception message has " java . lang .

Upgrade Android gradle support \n Specifically this bumps us to build - tools - 23 . 0 . 3 , gradle 2 . 10 , and the \n gradle Android plugin 2 . 1 . 0 . All of which was recommended after an \n upgrade to Android Studio 2 . 2 preview 2 .
Correct Travis CI jobs being killed \n This switches off the container based infrastructure in order to allow \n for greater memory consumption during the build , presumably needed by \n the dexing step in our Android build .
Remove databaseConnections API from the inspector builder \n This isn ' t necessary or appropriate as the functionality concretely \n relates to SqliteDatabaseDriver and not generically to any other \n database driver . For this reason , it should be provided there alone .
Fix stdin issue when the stream is read to exhaustion . \n This PR corrects a larger signedness mismatch between dumpapp client and \n server . The dumpapp client ( python ) used unsigned integers where the \n server ( Android / Java ) used signed integers due to a limitation in \n DataInput / OutputStream not supporting unsigned 32 and 64 - bit types \n ( technically this could be done with readLong & 0xffffffffff though ) . \n The critical fix comes in when sys . stdin . buffer . read reaches EOF whereby \n the client tried to pack - 1 in an unsigned int which is not obviously \n not possible . Since the server was always expecting this to be signed , simply \n correcting the client causes the problem to go away . \n Closes # 509
Handle any runtime exception from a database driver \n Since database drivers are such wide ranging third party code it \n cannot be assumed that they exclusively throw SQLiteException but \n instead could throw any manner of unknown RuntimeException and that \n should not tear down the connection with chrome : / / inspect but , since \n we are indeed a debug tool , should report sufficient debugging \n information to diagnose the issue .
Expand scraper . js support for events . \n This PR adds events ( instead of just commands ) support for scraper . js \n and fixes a crash when a type definition has no fields .
Improve error message when addInterceptor is used instead of addNetworkInterceptor \n Previously this would yield a NullPointerException and was not very \n discoverable / actionable for users . \n Closes # 580
Fix fatjar compilation including android support library R . class files \n These files would conflict with any other version of the support \n library the user tried to add and are not otherwise required or \n important for Stetho to function . \n Closes # 566

Default active resource retention false . \n Although Glide avoids recycling or mutating Bitmaps recovered from \n active resources via weak references , we can ' t prevent callers from \n doing so .

Since we can ' t guarantee that Glide ' s behavior is safe , it \n doesn ' t make sense to default this option on . \n That said , recycling or mutating Bitmaps returned by Glide isn ' t \n strictly safe either and is generally both bad and inefficient .

Add more robust cancellation support to MultiModelLoader . \n There ' s a race described in https : / / github . com / bumptech / glide / issues / 3343 where a child DataFetcher can call the MultiModelLoader after it has been cancelled , which can result in us unnecessarily starting a new load . Although we should probably also change the fetcher to avoid calling its callback after it ' s cancelled , we can make this behavior less of a problem in general by changing MultiModelLoader instead of relying on every individual DataFetcher implementation . \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n Created by MOE : https : / / github . com / google / moe \n MOE _ MIGRATED _ REVID = 216546841

Retain the hasAlphaBit when rotating images in TransformationUtils . \n This fixes a bug where camera images written with non - zero exif \n orientations are cached in Glide ' s disk cache as slower PNGs instead of \n JPEGs . Camera images without exif orientaiton or with 0 values for the \n exif orientation are unaffected . \n Images with exif orientations are always rotated by Downsampler using \n this method when they ' re decoded . The modified method writes the rotated \n image into a Bitmap acquired from the BitmapPool . Bitmaps in the pool \n default to having hasAlpha true because it ' s safer to retain \n transparency than not . The modified method previously did not update the \n newly obtained bitmap ' s hasAlpha flag with the value from the unrotated \n original . As a result , every image with exif orientation ended up in a \n bitmap with the hasAlpha flag set to true . In turn , BitmapEncoder would \n write all of these images to disk as PNGs because it assumes images with \n hasAlpha set to true might have transparency . Writing and reading PNGs \n is much slower than writing / reading JPEGs in general , so this causes a \n performance issue for Camera images , which , as a rule , do not have \n transparency ( and have hasAlpha set to false ) . \n To avoid the performance hit , this change sets the hasAlpha flag on \n rotated Bitmaps based on the value from the original unmodified Bitmap . \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n Created by MOE : https : / / github . com / google / moe \n MOE _ MIGRATED _ REVID = 218380242

Another approach to handling strange interceptor bodies . \n The previous approach Just Works if users have fancy or interesting interceptors \n that genuinely need to swap the response body in an interceptor and keep the \n original body . \n One problem with that solution is that although it gives expert users a powerful \n way to separate response bodies , it also allows normal users to accidentally leak \n response bodies in their interceptors . \n This is an alternate solution that forbids the expert use case and requires that \n closing the response body stream also closes the underlying socket stream . It \n throws an exception if that implicit contract is not honored . \n I ' m fine with either solution but think we should consider both .

Enhanced TextRunnerTest to catch missing return values .
Changed to static initialization for fPreferences in BaseTestRunner and excluded common problem causing packages .
Oops . Assertion tests can ' t use the standard format for exception tests because the exception to be thrown is AssertionFailedError and the exception that signals failure is also AssertionFailedError .
Deleted unnecessary . vcm _ meta file .
Fixed timing problem in TextFeedbackTest . testError ( )
The problem is better solved by only using ComparisonFailure \n when comparing Strings . Once we have more experience of \n actual usage of ComparisonFailure , we can consider expanding \n it to comparisons of objects .
Deleted deprecated methods and classes , this time really
Factored out commonality between ComparisonFailure and Assert . There still looks to be more to do in Assert itself .
Began writing tests for the textui . TestRunner in preparation for refactoring
Why didn ' t this get added automatically , oh Eclipse gods ?
Make sure an exception thrown during tearDown ( ) doesn ' t mask an \n exception thrown during running the test . I don ' t much like the TestCase . runBare ( ) \n code but I can ' t see how to simplify it . It was so much simpler before . Sniff . . .

Corrected javadoc to refer to early versions as 3 . 8 . x
Fixed problem with null message to fail ( )
Fixed problems with assertEquals ( null , String , String ) and return code when classes aren ' t found .
Comparing arrays declared as Object now uses array comparison . There was also a strange change to the . classpath file that I reverted . \n - - Kent
Added class names to error message when two values fail the equality test but produce the same toString ( ) .
Added explicit test for subclasses that only inherit test methods .
Simplified Theories . Factored out ignoring violated assumptions into its own Link .
Added Johannes Link ' s test for running subclasses of Suite
Found a final home for runBefores ( ) and runAfters ( )
Fixed 1857283 , assertEquals ( null , " null )
Added protected Suite ( Class < ? > klass , Class < ? > [ ] suiteClasses ) to support ClasspathSuite . This still needs a test .
* * * empty log message * * *

NetworkNotificationManager gets NotificationManager locally \n It ' s confusing that NetworkNotificationManager uses \n NotificationManager to put up notifcation which is passed from \n ConnectivityService .

Add CI action to generate ` gh - pages `
Try a different CI action \n The previous CI action published the whole git project to the branch , \n only replacing the ` . adoc ` files with ` . html ` versions . This meant that \n the actual ASCIIDoc site lived in a weird subdirectory , which isn ' t \n ideal . This action seems to suggest that it will only publish a certain \n directory , which might be better for what we want ?
Use different workflows for ` master ` / other branches \n We wouldn ' t want branches or pull requests overwriting the GH pages , so \n for anything that isn ' t the ` master ` branch we should still build the \n ASCIIDocs , just don ' t do the final action to push the generated files
Stop generating JavaDoc into ` / docs ` \n We don ' t need to put the JavaDoc in ` / docs ` since it should no longer \n be committed to the repository .
Replace the " getting started " reference with " User Guide " \n Try to deprecate the Wiki documentation , although the FAQ still exists \n on Github ( for now ) !
Restore Disruptor - 1 . 0 . pdf \n Many places on the Internet link directly to this PDF , and updating all \n of those links seems like a bit of a faff . It would be nice if in the \n future we could generate the PDF from the ` . adoc ` as well , but for now \n it ' s easier to just re - introduce the original version

Use InternalThreadLocal in consumer side ( # 1825 ) \n * SerializerFactory 获取Serializer时，锁住整个hashmap，导致整个过程被block \n * 单元测试。保证一个class只有一个serializer和deserializer。单线程和多线程测试 \n * 增加线程数 50 模拟多个线程来获取serializer和deserializer \n * 当cores线程数全都使用的情况下，默认线程池会把任务放入到队列中。队列满则再创建线程（总数不会超过Max线程数） \n 增强线程池：在请求量阶段性出现高峰时使用 \n 特性：cores线程全部使用的情况下，优先创建线程（总数不会超过max），当max个线程全都在忙的情况下，才将任务放入队列。请求量下降时，线程池会自动维持cores个线程，多余的线程退出。 \n * 当cores线程数全都使用的情况下，默认线程池会把任务放入到队列中。队列满则再创建线程（总数不会超过Max线程数） \n 增强线程池：在请求量阶段性出现高峰时使用 \n 特性：cores线程全部使用的情况下，优先创建线程（总数不会超过max），当max个线程全都在忙的情况下，才将任务放入队列。请求量下降时，线程池会自动维持cores个线程，多余的线程退出。 \n * 补全单元测试，测试扩展是否生效 \n * 错误命名 \n * 增加 @ Override注解 \n long 初始化赋值时，小写l改为大写L防止误读 \n * 修复单元测试 \n * remove enhanced \n * remove enhanced \n * Change ThreadFactory for consumer side which is to use InternalThreadLocal in RpcContext .
SelectedSelectionKeySet should only be created if the set can be instrumented \n Motivation : \n If we can not replace the internal used Set of the Selector there is no need to create an SelectedSelectionKeySet instance . \n Modification : \n Only create SelectedSelectionKeySet if we will replace the internal set . \n Result : \n Less object creation in some cases and cleaner code .
Replace ConcurrentHashMap at allLeaks with a thread - safe set ( # 8467 ) \n Motivation : \n allLeaks is to store the DefaultResourceLeak . When we actually use it , the key is DefaultResourceLeak , and the value is actually a meaningless value . \n We only care about the keys of allLeaks and don ' t care about the values . So Set is more in line with this scenario . \n Using Set as a container is more consistent with the definition of a container than Map . \n Modification : \n Replace allLeaks with set . Create a thread - safe set using ' Collections . newSetFromMap ( new ConcurrentHashMap < DefaultResourceLeak < ? > , Boolean > ( ) ) . '
Optimize getExtensionClass method . ( # 2788 ) \n Just return the class instead of throwing exception .
* fix a bug when the provider write a throwable into aysnc context ( # 1946 ) \n * sth doc \n * simple code
Make channel final because of using in inner class . ( # 2086 )
* Improve AsyncContext docs ( # 2101 ) \n * Make the future final which is in the constructor of AsyncRpcResult because of using in a inner class .
Fix a bug when client reconnect ( # 2135 ) \n * Add reconnection lock to control only one thread can can reconnect method . \n This will avoid problem in this case : \n Thread A reconnecting , and success , then send msg . \n Thread B reconnecting but invoke disconnect . Then the Thread A will send msg fail because of Thread B ' s disconnecting call . \n * fix sth

Replace map with set . ( # 9833 ) \n Motivation : \n Replace Map with Set . ` reportedLeaks ` has better semantics as a Set , and if it is a Map , it seems that the value of this Map has no meaning to us . \n Modifications : \n Use Set . \n Result : \n Cleaner code
Shorten the life cycle of TimeoutTask to avoid frequent gc . ( # 4040 )
Clean up expired docs . ( # 9756 ) \n Motivation : \n Since the ` extractFrame ` has used ` retainedSlice ` to avoid memory copy , we should clean this doc that was expired . \n Result : \n Better doc .

Close encoder when handlerRemoved . ( # 9950 ) \n Motivation : \n We should close encoder when ` LzfEncoder ` was removed from pipeline . \n Modification : \n call ` encoder . close ` when ` handlerRemoved ` triggered . \n Result : \n Close encoder to release internal buffer .
