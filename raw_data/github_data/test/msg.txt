Change switch to if ( # 10880 ) \n Motivation : \n switch is used when we have a good amount of cases because switch is faster than if - else . However , we ' re using only 1 case in switch which can affect performance . \n Modification : \n Changed switch to if . \n Result : \n Good code .

Remove bytecode text test kt15806 . kt \n It ' s not correct to expect that the backend generates the ` when ` in this \n test as tableswitch because there are only two branches . JVM IR has a \n cutoff in the when optimization and generates ` when ` s with fewer than 3 \n branches as if - else chains , which is probably better . Note that there ' s \n also a corresponding box test in when / enumOptimization / , so the backend \n behavior is still tested .

Fix HomeToolbar popupTheme in non - night mode ( # 820 ) \n - materialThemeOverlay doesn ' t work for AppCompatToolbar \n - since the style is being set explicitly ( activity _ home ) , we can use ` android : theme ` , and this will be applied as an overlay \n - the popup menu is already taking ` colorSurface ` correctly , but not sure why it ' s not setting the text accordingly . Overriding textColorPrimary to colorOnSurface fixes it , while applying it in a small scope ( only to the HomeToolbar ' s popupTheme ) means we won ' t goof anything else up

Reference - counted SslEngines retain a reference to their parent SslContext ( # 9626 ) \n Motivation : \n With the Netty ref - counted OpenSSL implementation the parent SslContext \n maintains state necessary for the SslEngine ' s it produces . However , it ' s \n possible for the parent context to be closed and release those resources \n before the child engines are finished which causes problems . \n Modification : \n Spawned ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine ' s retain a reference to their \n parent ReferenceCountedOpenSslContext . \n Result : \n The lifetime of the shared data is extended to include the lifetime of \n the dependents .

Don ' t double record stacktrace in Annotated * Exception ( # 9117 ) \n Motivation : \n When initializing the AnnotatedSocketException in AbstractChannel , both \n the cause and the stack trace are set , leaving a trailing " Caused By " \n that is compressed when printing the trace . \n Modification : \n Don ' t include the stack trace in the exception , but leave it in the cause . \n Result : \n Clearer stack trace
Unconditionally initialize sockaddrs in epoll linuxsocket ( # 9299 ) \n Motivation : \n Compiling with - Werror , - Wuninitialized complains about the sockaddrs being uninitialized . \n I believe this is because the init function netty _ unix _ socket _ initSockaddr is in a \n separate compilation unit . Since this code isn ' t on the criticial path , it ' s easy \n to just memset the variables rather than suppress the warning . \n Modification : \n Always clear the sockaddrs , even if they will be initialized later . \n Result : \n Able to compile with warnings turned on
Handle missing methods on ChannelHandlerMask ( # 9221 ) \n Motivation : \n When Netty is run through ProGuard , seemingly unused methods are removed . This breaks reflection , making the Handler skipping throw a reflective error . \n Modification : \n If a method is seemingly absent , just disable the optimization . \n Result : \n Dealing with ProGuard sucks infinitesimally less .

[ ML ] Increase memory estimates for categorization ( # 68859 ) \n Previously we estimated 5MB per categorizer within the overall \n job model memory estimate . 5MB is a reasonable estimate in the \n case where categorization works well and creates a few hundred \n categories , and the examples are not too big . However , for \n messages that do not categorize well and create thousands of \n categories it can be much too low . \n We introduced the stop _ on _ warn option to prevent log formats \n that do not categorize well from blowing up categorization \n memory usage . But even then it is possible that some log \n formats may require extra space for large examples . \n This change doubles the estimate per categorizer to 10MB , and \n in cases where per - partition categorization is enabled but \n stop _ on _ warn is not doubles this again to 20MB , as it is very \n likely that there will be some message types that do not \n categorize well . \n Message types that do not categorize well will still cause the \n job to go to the hard _ limit memory status if stop _ on _ warn is \n not enabled , but at least they will run a bit longer before \n doing this , allowing a fuller picture of how categorization is \n working for other partitions to be observed . The only long \n term fix for partitions that do not categorize well for some \n reason remains to stop categorizing , as stop _ on _ warn would .

Configuration to process annotations on ` gradle assemble ` \n We override compileJava ' s doFirst method in order to add AndroidAnnotations \n to the compile process . This allows Gradle to generate the annotations before \n compiling the rest of the code . \n Unfortunately , the generated code is outputted to build / gen instead of simply \n the gen folder . This means that while the annotated classes are processed \n correctly during a ` gradle assemble ` , they do not show up inside IDEA and must \n be rebuilt manually to generate . It should be possible to point the output \n folders of both Gradle and IDEA to the same location , but I haven ' t really \n looked into that yet . \n Signed - off - by : Ealden Esto E .

Add new ReactMarkers for bridgeless init start / end \n Summary : Adding two new ReactMarkers for start and end of bridgeless initialization . Creating new ones instead of reusing existing ones to make it easier to differentiate data from the bridge vs . bridgeless , and also because our existing markers 1 ) aren ' t very easy to understand , and 2 ) don ' t map cleanly to the new architecture . \n Reviewed By : PeteTheHeat \n Differential Revision : D23789156 \n fbshipit - source - id : 2ed10769e08604e591503a2bc9566aeb1d0563ed
Use bridgeless flag instead of specific binding in UIManagerBinding \n Summary : \n This fix is still a little hypothetical . We have a few different JS errors that we ' re seeing with bridgeless mode that seem to be caused by Fabric trying to access ` _ _ fbBatchedBridge ` from C + + . I think what ' s happening is : \n 1 . User encounters an unrelated JS error very early in rendering a new surface ( possibly while the bundle is still loading ? ) \n 2 . In release builds , BridgelessReactFragment handles the error by stopping the surface and rendering a retry button ( actually , the surface is stopped in a bunch of places in BaseFbReactFragment , which might be why this is popping up now - I recently refactored that class to share more of its logic in bridgeless mode ) \n 3 . Fabric stops the surface by first checking to see if the custom binding ` RN $ stopSurface ` exists ; if not , it falls back to calling the registered callable module ` ReactFabric ` . \n I think # 3 is where things are going wrong for bridgeless mode ; if you call stopSurface before ` RN $ stopSurface ` is installed ( which happens when ReactFabric shim is required ) then you ' ll fall back to the bridge version . \n My solution here is to instead rely on a flag set in C + + to determine whether we ' re in bridgeless mode , and then check to see if the stopSurface binding has been installed . If not , we just noop - if the ReactFabric shim hasn ' t been required , we probably don ' t actually have a React surface that needs to be stopped . \n At least , that ' s my current theory . We ' ll see if this actually works . \n Changelog : [ Fixed ] [ iOS ] Fix an issue calling stopSurface in bridgeless mode before surface is started \n Reviewed By : mdvacca \n Differential Revision : D25453696 \n fbshipit - source - id : bff76675c43989101d0ba5ae0aba60089db230bf

Fix page splitter creating large dictionary page list \n Page splitter does not work well for dictionary blocks . When a split \n happens on a dictionary block , the dictionary will be shallow copied \n into the two split pages . Both these two pages will still be large \n because of the dictionary . Recursion will continue until there is one \n row per page and a large dictionary in each split page . The fix is to \n stop splitting once we do not see enough improvement after a split .
Fix like pattern interpretation \n like pattern constant folding happens only when the optimization level \n is above SERIALIZABLE .

Under such \n case , tryHandleLike expects the given constant folded like pattern \n should always be a compiled Regex but is not in the above case . \n The patch relaxes the restriction on the like pattern to be more \n generic . As long as the return type is Regex , tryHandleLike should be \n able to handle it .

Remove UNSAFE _ componentWillReceiveProps \n Summary : \n This diff removes ` UNSAFE _ componentWillReceiveProps ` and adds the changes to ` componentDidUpdate ` instead . \n Why use ` componentDidUpdate ` ? When reading through the [ React docs on removing UNSAFE _ componentWillReceiveProps ] ( https : / / reactjs . org / docs / react - component . html # unsafe _ componentwillreceiveprops ) , it says : \n > If you need to perform a side effect ( for example , data fetching or an animation ) in response to a change in props , use componentDidUpdate lifecycle instead . \n The original usage of ` UNSAFE _ componentWillReceiveProps ` updates the content inset when ` props . contentInset ` changes . However , we don ' t always want it to update if the content inset hasn ' t changed , as calling ` setValue ` will reset the animated value unnecessarily , and kill any current animations ( which we don ' t want to do ) .

Add to an RNTester ScrollView example a TextInput and a Button to test keyboardShouldPersistTaps \n Summary : \n This is an example from RNTester .

Improve logging for why a staged session was reverted \n mFailureReason gets populated with actual reason when we try to resume \n the staged session in checkpointing mode . But , if the device has a \n native crash due to which the device reboots even before we attempt to \n " resume " staged session , then it will never get populated . \n As such , during boot loops that occur earlier than " resume " of staged \n session , we end up logging nothing . \n In this CL , we improve on the scenario by falling back to using \n mNativeFailureReason if mFailureReason is empty . But this only works if \n our staged session contains APEX package in it . For apk - only staged \n sessions , we will still be logging blanks . \n Bug : 163787002 \n Test : atest ApexRollbackTests # testReasonForRevertIsLoggedDuringBootloop \n Change - Id : I5cd1733d66aa0b30855803b95eb9818dc81aa0d7 \n Merged - In : I5cd1733d66aa0b30855803b95eb9818dc81aa0d7 \n ( cherry picked from commit a4cb493bdb69488a9b94aae627545aa91db55083 )

Make some inner classes static ( # 9624 ) \n Motivation : \n Classes ` AbstractHttp2StreamChannel . Http2StreamChannelConfig ` \n and ` DnsNameResolver . AddressedEnvelopeAdapter ` may be static : \n it doesn ' t reference its enclosing instance . \n Modification : \n Add ` static ` modifier . \n Result : \n Prevents a possible memory leak and uses less memory per class instance .
Fix possible NPE in DefaultHttp2UnknownFrame # equals ( # 9625 ) \n Motivation : \n ` DefaultHttp2UnknownFrame # equals ` may produce NPE due to \n incorrect comparison of ` stream ` field . \n Modification : \n - Fix the ` stream ` field compare . \n - Cleanup usage of class fields : use direct access instead of getters \n ( because the class is final ) . \n Result : \n No NPE in ` equals ` method .

Mark line number after emitting children . \n Marking the line number before emitting children leads to incorrect line numbers \n when a runtime error occurs . For example , when \n ( foo bar \n baz ) \n is emitted the compiler will visit the line number for the expression , then emit \n the children expressions ( ' bar ' and ' baz ' ) which will mark their own line \n numbers , then come back and emit the invoke bytecode for ' foo ' , but since the \n last line number to be marked was that of ' baz ' , if ' foo ' throws an exception \n the line number of ' baz ' will be reported instead of the line number for the \n expression as a whole . \n This same issue was being manifested with special forms and inlined functions , \n and was especially bad in the case of the threading macro ' - > ' , because it is \n usually spread across several lines , and the line number reported could end up \n being very different than the line actually causing an exception . \n Signed - off - by : Stuart Halloway < stu @ cognitect . com >

Register UNKNOWN type same way as other types
Limit the codegen class name length \n We use the function signature as class name for codegened classes . \n When ROW types are used , sometimes the name gets extremely long . Since \n we use an AtomicLong as part of the generated class name we should be \n able to guarantee uniqueness without using the full name . So truncate \n at 100 characters .
Generate shorter aggregation function names \n We use return type an input types when generating aggregation function names . \n This could make the name really long ( tens of KB ) when complex ROW types are \n used . This would waste memory and make the generated name unreadable . So only \n keep the first 10 characters of each type parameter when generating the name .

ByteBufUtil to not pool direct memory by default \n Motivation : \n ByteBufUtil by default will cache DirectByteBuffer objects , and the \n associated direct memory ( up to 64k ) . In combination with the Recycler which may \n cache up to 32k elements per thread may lead to a large amount of direct \n memory being retained per EventLoop thread .

DefaultPromise internal state dependent on Signal \n Motivation : \n DefaultPromise ' s internal state depends upon specific Signal objects .

DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder async SETTINGS ACK SimpleChannelPromiseAggregator promise usage \n Motivaiton : \n DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder uses SimpleChannelPromiseAggregator to combine two \n operations into a single future status .

This may result in premature completion of the aggregated future . \n Modifications : \n - DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder to use \n SimpleChannelPromiseAggregator # newPromise ( ) instead of directly using the \n SimpleChannelPromiseAggregator instance when writing the settings ACK frame \n Result : \n More correct status for the SETTING ACK frame writing when auto settings ACK is \n disabled .
HTTP / 2 avoid closing connection when writing GOAWAY ( # 9227 ) \n Motivation : \n b4e3c12b8e8e984ba65330dd6dc34a4b3d07a25a introduced code to avoid coupling \n close ( ) to graceful close . It also added some code which attempted to infer when \n a graceful close was being done in writing of a GOAWAY to preserve the \n " connection is closed when all streams are closed behavior " for the child \n channel API . However the implementation was too overzealous and may preemptively \n close the connection if there are not currently any open streams ( and close if \n there are any frames which create streams in flight ) . \n Modifications : \n - Decouple writing a GOAWAY from trying to infer if a graceful close is being \n done and closing the connection . Even if we could enhance this logic ( e . g . \n wait to close until the second GOAWAY with no error ) it is possible the user \n doesn ' t want the connection to be closed yet . We can add a means for the codec \n to orchestrate the graceful close in the future ( e . g . write some special " close \n the connection when all streams are closed " ) but for now we can just let the \n application handle this . \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9207
Avoid auto boxing in PoolChunk # removeAvailRun ( # 10769 ) \n Motivation : \n PoolChunk maintains multiple PriorityQueue < Long > collections .

This creates unnecessary allocations via Long . valueOf ( long ) . \n Modifications : \n - Adjust method signature and usage of PoolChunk # removeAvailRun to avoid \n boxing \n Result : \n Less allocations as a result of PoolChunk # removeAvailRun .

Improve check that thread is stopped \n The new code is hopefully easier to understand because it makes it \n explicit that it checks that the statement is stopped within a period \n of time that is close to the timeout .

Skip unreferenced files pruning after restore for searchable snapshots shards ( # 68821 ) \n When a shard is restored from a snapshot there is an after \n restore step during which files on disk that are not referenced \n anymore by the restored segments infos file are deleted from \n disk . The deletion is executed using the \n Lucene . pruneUnreferencedFiles ( ) method which opens a new \n IndexWriter and closes it in order to kick off Lucene ' s internal \n index files deleter . \n This step is not necessary for searchable snapshot shards \n which use the snapshot store type because such shards \n report a list of files coming from a shard snapshot which \n never contain unreferenced files . Skipping this step avoids \n extra unnecessary work when mounting a searchable \n snapshot index .

CLJ - 1024 : Check for invalid varags / destrucuring uses . \n Protocol , interface method declarations don ' t allow for varags and \n destructuring support . Currently , for example \n ( defprotocol FooBar \n ( foo [ this & more ] ) ) \n compiles just fine , and & is interpreted as a usual argument that happens to be \n named & without special meaning . But clearly , the user wanted to specify a \n varags parameter here . The same applies to definterface . \n Similarly , providing method implementations via defrecord , deftype , and reify \n don ' t allow for varags ( but dynamic extenions via extend do ) . \n So this patch makes defprotocol and definterface throw an \n IllegalArgumentException if a user tries to use varargs and destructuring in \n method signatures . \n Similarly , defrecord , deftype , and reify throw an IllegalArgumentException if \n any method implementation arglist contains a varargs argument . \n Signed - off - by : Stuart Halloway < stu @ thinkrelevance . com >

Hiero : Default to crash - less Java renderer , return to it if Freetype would cause crash ( # 6403 ) \n * If a font lacks ' x ' , fall back to Arial and place a note . \n The note can be easily removed just by pressing the ASCII , NeHe , or Extended buttons , but it lets the user know why Arial was selected instead of some emoji - only font or something . \n * If a font is missing ' x ' and we use Freetype , switch to Java . \n Only Freetype rendering has an issue with missing ' x ' chars . Java and Native don ' t necessarily show anything if the font has no ASCII chars , but they don ' t crash . \n * We don ' t need the ' x ' check if we default to Java rendering . \n This also enables the effects right away , which I think are a major reason people use Hiero . \n Also , now the Java radio button is selected safely if ' x ' is missing and Freetype is currently selected . The bold and italic checkboxes are also restored as part of that .
Clean up MathUtils . random ( ) for generating longs ( # 6412 ) \n * Complex fix for MathUtils . random ( long ) . \n This one ' s an especially intricate piece of code , and the bug it fixes is sorta non - obvious . Before , if you called ` MathUtils . nextLong ( Long . MAX _ VALUE ) ` many times , you would never get a number with a ` 1 ` bit in any of the bottom 10 bits . This is obviously not random ; the lack of odd numbers might be the most easily noticeable . That happens because the old code used a double ( with 52 bits of mantissa ) to generate a random long ( with 64 bits ) . The ensuing precision loss affects all large - enough ranges . The fix is to use Rafael Baptista ' s technique for getting the upper 64 bits of a 64x64 - to - 128 - bit multiply , treating the inputs as unsigned . It still works for negative bounds , like before , and is inclusive . It also has a speedup if the bound is one less than a power of two ( such as for ` Long . MAX _ VALUE ` ) , since not as much work is needed there . \n * Fix up random ( long , long ) so larger ranges can be produced . \n * Allow UUIDs to use the sign bit . \n Before , they were only positive longs for each portion of the UUID , and before this PR , they were only using 53 bits of each 64 - bit long . \n * Add a test to make sure . \n Co - authored - by : Nathan Sweet < nathan . sweet @ gmail . com >

Unify parameter validation ' s code style . ( # 9778 ) \n Motivation : \n Unify parameter validation ' s code style . \n Modifications : \n Change the parameter ' s validation statements to the method : ObjectUtil . checkNotNull . \n Result : \n The parameter ' s validation code will keep same style with other codes
Improve java doc for MINIMAL _ WAIT ( # 9779 ) \n Motivation : \n MINIMAL _ WAIT is the key constant . Thus , When we see the constant , we must read more code logic to see if it is ms or ns . So improving java doc will be better . \n Modifications : \n Improve java doc by add " 10ms " such as DEFAULT _ CHECK _ INTERVAL with " 1s " . \n Result : \n Easy to know it is ms and keep same java doc style with other constants such as DEFAULT _ CHECK _ INTERVAL .
Add one new constructor with threadFactory only ( # 9773 ) \n Motivation : \n In most cases , we want to use MultithreadEventLoopGroup such as NioEventLoopGroup without setting thread numbers but thread name only . So we need to use followed code : \n NioEventLoopGroup boss = new NioEventLoopGroup ( 0 , new DefaultThreadFactory ( " boss " ) ) ; \n It looks a bit confuse or strange for the number 0 due to we only want to set thread name . So it will be better to add new constructor for this case . \n Modifications : \n add new constructor into all event loop groups , for example : public NioEventLoopGroup ( ThreadFactory threadFactory ) \n Result : \n User can only set thread factory without setting the thread number to 0 : \n NioEventLoopGroup boss = new NioEventLoopGroup ( new DefaultThreadFactory ( " boss " ) ) ;

Sort output of ` query - - order _ output = auto ` lexicographically by default . \n The ` - - incompatible _ lexicographical _ output ` flag has two effects when used together with ` - - order _ output = auto ` : \n 1 . It sorts the output lexicographically . \n 2 . It uses the graphless query implementation . \n Sorting the output lexicographically allows us to make the outputs of query and genquery consistent . \n By using the graphless query implementation , query performance improves by at least ~ 60 % in wall time ( from some of our benchmarks ) . \n The flag is ignored when ` somepath ` is used as a top level function ( e . g . ` query ' somepath ( a , b ) ' ` ) , and continue to output in dependency order instead of lexicographical order . \n Using ` - - order _ output = no ` would make query even faster if you do not require a lexicographically sorted or deterministic output . \n RELNOTES [ INC ] : Query ` - - order _ output = auto ` will now sort lexicographically . However , when ` somepath ` is used as a top level function ( e . g . ` query ' somepath ( a , b ) ' ` ) , it will continue to output in dependency order . If you do not want the lexicographical output ordering , specify another ` - - order _ output ` value ( ` no ` , ` deps ` or ` full ` ) based on what ordering you require . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 356483939

FlushConsolidationHandler may suppress flushes by mistake ( # 9931 ) \n Motivation : \n When ` consolidatedWhenNoReadInProgress ` is true , ` channel . writeAndFlush ( data ) . addListener ( f - > channel . writeAndFlush ( data2 ) ) ` Will cause data2 to never be flushed . \n Because the flush operation will synchronously execute the ` channel . writeAndFlush ( data2 ) ) ` in the ` listener ` , and at this time , since the current execution thread is still an ` eventloop ` ( ` executor . inEventLoop ( ) ` was true ) , all handlers will be executed synchronously . At this time , since ` nextScheduledFlush ` is still not null , the ` flush ` operation of ` data2 ` will be ignored in ` FlushConsolidationHandler # scheduleFlush ` . \n Modification : \n - reset ` nextScheduledFlush ` before ` ctx . flush ` \n - use ` ObjectUtil ` to polish code \n Result : \n Fixes https : / / github . com / netty / netty / issues / 9923
Introduce ` needReport ` for ` ResourceLeakDetector ` . ( # 9910 ) \n Motivation : \n We can extend ` ResourceLeakDetector ` through ` ResourceLeakDetectorFactory ` , and then report the leaked information by covering ` reportTracedLeak ` and ` reportUntracedLeak ` . However , the behavior of ` reportTracedLeak ` and ` reportUntracedLeak ` is controlled by ` logger . isErrorEnabled ( ) ` , which is not reasonable . In the case of extending ` ResourceLeakDetector ` , we sometimes need ` needReport ` to always return true instead of relying on ` logger . isErrorEnabled ( ) ` . \n Modification : \n introduce ` needReport ` method and let it be ` protected ` \n Result : \n We can control the report leak behavior .
