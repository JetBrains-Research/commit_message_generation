Fix overflow bug in GenericEventExecutorChooser ( # 10468 ) \n Motivation : \n The executor chooser should pluck executors in round - robin , but at the 32 - bit \n overflow boundary , the round - robin sequence was disrupted when the number of \n executors are not a power of 2 . \n Modification : \n Changed the index counter from a 32 - bit to a 64 - bit long . The overflow bug is \n still technically there , but it now takes so long to reach that it will never \n happen in practice . For example , 2 ^ 63 nanoseconds is almost 300 years . \n Result : \n The round - robin behaviour for all EventExecutorChoosers is now preserved in \n practice . \n This fixes # 10423 .
Let object serialisation exceptions propagate in the Object Echo example ( # 10807 ) \n Motivation : \n People may use the object serialisation example as a vehicle to test out sending their own objects across the wire . \n If those objects are not actually serialisable for some reason , then we need to let the exception propagate so that this becomes obvious to people . \n Modification : \n Add a listener to the future that sends the first serialisable message , so that we ensure that any exceptions that shows up during serialisation becomes visible . \n Without this , the state of the future that sent the first message was never checked or inspected anywhere . \n Result : \n Serialisation bugs in code derived from the Object Echo example are much easier to diagnose . \n This fixes # 10777
Propagate SetBindings settings in the copy constructor .
Loosen the extent to which we trap and report exceptions . \n A few are thrown by javac internals - most notably com . sun . tools . javac . code . Symbol - that javac knows how to deal with . Or at the very least , trapping these and reporting them as build errors on elements is misleading . \n So in the above case , pass the exception through . The code change uses a set , to leave room for adding others when and if they show up ( whether from javac or other sources , like ecj , etc . ) \n This change also alters the wording of the reported error when we don ' t pass through , so it ' s clearer this isn ' t coming from a Dagger validation failure , but a deeper cause .

Prevent field API NPEs from token _ count fields inside nested ( # 69068 ) \n Currently when a ` token _ count ` field is defined inside a nested field , we get an \n NPE because the underlying DocValueFetcher needs its formattedDocValues to be \n loaded and the SourceLookup it sees needs to have a valid docId other than - 1 . \n This change fixes those issues so the whole fields request doesn ' t error . \n However this change doesn ' t solve the missing support for doc values lookup \n under nested fields described in 68983 . Fortunately ` token _ count ` seems to be the only \n mapping type currently affected . \n Relates to # 68983

[ ML ] Fix logic for moving . ml - state - write alias from legacy to new ( # 69039 ) \n When multiple jobs start up together on a node following \n an upgrade , each one of them will trigger a check that the \n . ml - state * indices are as expected and the . ml - state - write \n alias points to the correct index . \n There were a couple of flaws in the logic : \n 1 . We were not considering the possibility that one or more \n existing . ml - state * indices might be hidden . \n 2 . If multiple jobs tried to create a . ml - state - 000001 index \n simultaneously all but the first would fail . We accounted \n for this , but then did not follow up with the correct alias \n update request for those index creation requests that \n failed . This could cause all but one of the jobs starting \n up on the node to spuriously fail . \n Both these problems are fixed by this PR . \n Fixes # 68925

deprecate own ConcurrentSet for removal ( # 8340 ) \n Motivation : \n Java since version 6 has the wrapper for the ConcurrentHashMap that could be created via Collections . newSetFromMap ( map ) . So no need to create own ConcurrentSet class . Also , since netty plans to switch to Java 8 soon there is another method for that - ConcurrentHashMap . newKeySet ( ) . \n For now , marking this class @ deprecated would be enough , just to warn users who use netty ' s ConcurrentSet . After switching to Java 8 ConcurrentSet should be removed and replaced with ConcurrentHashMap . newKeySet ( ) . \n Modification : \n ConcurrentSet deprecated .

Prevent scrolling with TalkBack if scrolling is disabled in JS \n Summary : \n Right now you can scroll a horizontal ScrollView with TalkBack even if you ' ve disabled scrolling in JS , because our HorizontalScrollView component doesn ' t prevent the accessibility scroll event ( this doesn ' t seem to happen with vertical ScrollViews for some reason . . . ) This diff adds an accessibility delegate to both of the Android ScrollView components to make sure they ' re not scrollable if scrolling has been disabled in JS . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : shergin \n Differential Revision : D23582689 \n fbshipit - source - id : b670bdb462ab9c963c7125597d60ca97c7d88a9c
Support for serialization of NaN , Inifity and - Infinity \n JSON has no support for NaN , Inifity and - Infinity but we can serialize them as \n " NaN " , " Inifity " and " - Infinity " and chrome ' s console will be just fine . \n Without this patch stetho will crash violently when these values are serialized \n back .
JsConsole no longer references its JavasSript prototype \n Turns out that we never use the prototype so we don ' t need to keep it \n lying around . \n We can also remove the public constructor since it will be empty and java \n does provide one by default .
Delete temporary self - signed certs in SSLEngineTest - based tests \n Motivation : \n Lots of usages of SelfSignedCertificates were not deleting the certs at \n the end of the test . This includes setupHandlers ( ) which is used by \n extending classes . Although these files will be deleted at JVM exit and \n deleting them early does not free the JVM from trying to delete them at \n shutdown , it ' s good practice to delete eagerly and since users sometimes \n use tests as a form of documentation , it ' d be good for them to see the \n explicit deletes . \n Modifications : \n Add missing delete ( ) calls to ½ of the SelfSignedCertificates - using \n tests . \n Result : \n Tests that more clearly communicates which resources are created and \n may accumulate without early delete .
Adapt to API changes in Conscrypt 1 . 0 . 0 . RC11 \n Motivation : \n In google / conscrypt # 313 the Conscrypt . Engines class was removed in favor \n of methods directly on Conscrypt and overloading . The Conscrypt - using \n code in Netty used reflection to access the old API , that doesn ' t exist \n anymore . And thus recent versions of Conscrypt fail to enable things \n like ALPN with Netty . \n Modifications : \n Instead of calling Conscrypt . Engines . isConscrypt , call \n Conscrypt . isConscrypt . \n Result : \n Conscrypt detected properly at runtime .

Fix issue that can hide slow network requests \n WebKit Inspector contains an apparent implementation bug whereby if the \n request does not provide a Page . ResourceType guess then it will hide it \n from the UI until Network . responseReceived is delivered with the actual \n Page . ResourceType is given . This works fine when there is a small delay \n between requestWillBeSent and responseReceived , but if the delay widens \n significantly , the Inspector UI will discard the record and fail to show \n it no matter how progress is made after that point . \n This can be demonstrated by adding significant timing delays in network \n events ( such as by using iptables to slow down or stop traffic entirely ) \n or just adding delays in NetworkEventReporterImpl .
Work around an issue causing network requests to disappear from the UI \n This works around an apparent upstream bug in which a new undocumented \n field which , if not added , will cause a JavaScript error to occur in the \n UI and the row will be removed during Network . loadingFailed . This \n appears to be a related regression to that fixes in PR # 10 .

Fix propagating underlying caps when a network disconnects . \n aosp / 1513052 , which generalized support for underlying networks , \n broke default network switching when the network underlying a VPN \n disconnects . \n This is because it calls propagateUnderlyingNetworkCapabilities \n in the middle of the bookkeeping operations needed when a \n network is disconnected ( specifically , after all satisified \n requests are removed from the disconnecting network , but before \n mDefaultNetworkNai is updated ) . This is completely incorrect \n because propagateUnderlyingNetworkCapabilities can trigger a \n network rematch , and running a rematch when the request data \n structures are inconsistent is obviously wrong . See the test \n changes in this CL for an example of the damage . \n Fix this by moving propagateUnderlyingNetworkCapabilities to \n before the bookeeping operations begin . It must be before \n mDefaultNetworkNai is updated , because otherwise it will not know \n that the default network is disconnecting , and it will not be \n able to propagate capabilities to VPNs that set underlying \n networks to null ( i . e . , to the default network ) .

Minor fix in dynamic template validation ( # 66166 ) \n As part of # 66156 the validation of dynamic templates has been adapted to support runtime fields . As part of that change , a ` break ` was forgotten , which causes needless additional validation rounds after a template has been already successfully validated against one of the field types .
MappingLookup to not implement Iterable ( # 64951 ) \n Implementing Iterable makes it hard to track who iterates through the mappers , and also it is not super clear what it allows to iterate through given that the object holds both field mappers and field types . \n This commit replaces implementing Iterable with a specific method called fieldMappers that returns an Iterable < Mapper >

Epoll : Don ' t wake event loop when splicing ( # 9354 ) \n Motivation \n I noticed this while looking at something else . \n AbstractEpollStreamChannel : : spliceQueue is an MPSC queue but only \n accessed from the event loop . So it could be just changed to e . g . an \n ArrayDeque . This PR instead reverts to using is as an MPSC queue to \n avoid dispatching a task to the EL , as appears was the original \n intention . \n Modification \n Change AbstractEpollStreamChannel : : spliceQueue to be volatile and lazily \n initialized via double - checked locking . Add tasks directly to the queue \n from the public methods rather than possibly waking the EL just to \n enqueue . \n An alternative is just to change PlatformDependent . newMpscQueue ( ) to new \n ArrayDeque ( ) and be done with it : ) \n Result \n Less disruptive channel / fd - splicing .

Fix preallocted breaker test failure ( # 67022 ) \n The randomized test for pre - allocated breakers would sometimes attempt \n to consume the entire request breaker and fail . This limits it to 100mb \n and aborts the test if that doesn ' t fit comfortable into the breaker . \n The 100mb limit also fixes another sneaky issue - the randomized values \n for the test used to depend on the size of the request breaker which \n itself depends on the size of the heap . We run the tests with 512m heap \n in gradle but IDEs are kind of the wild west . That made it very \n difficult to reproduce the issue . \n There is still some heap dependent randomization here , sadly . We use \n non - heap dependent randomization to bump the breaker but whether or not \n the breaker trips is dependent on heap size . This is , sadly , kind of \n inevitable because we want to test against a real breaker so we can make \n sure we handle circuit breaking sensibly .
Add new session property prefer _ manifests _ to _ list _ files \n When this property is enabled , we try to get the list of \n filenames , sizes from the Metastore partition and thereby avoid \n listFiles call to underlying storage .

Drop JUnit assertEquals calls in favor of Truth assertThat .
Don ' t check accessible in the # capacity method ( # 7830 ) \n Motivation : \n The ` # ensureAccessible ` method in ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf # capacity ` used \n to prevent NPE if buffer is released and ` array ` is ` null ` . In all \n other implementations of ` ByteBuf ` the accessible is not checked by \n ` capacity ` method . We can assign an empty array to ` array ` \n in the ` deallocate ` and don ' t worry about NPE in the ` # capacity ` . \n This will help reduce the number of repeated calls of the \n ` # ensureAccessible ` in many operations with ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf ` . \n Modifications : \n 1 . Remove ` # ensureAccessible ` call from ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf # capacity ` . \n Use the ` EmptyArrays # EMPTY _ BYTES ` instead of ` null ` in ` # deallocate ` . \n 2 . Fix access checks in ` AbstractUnsafeSwappedByteBuf ` and \n ` AbstractByteBuf # slice ` that relied on ` # ensureAccessible ` \n in ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf # capacity ` . This was found by unit tests . \n Result : \n Less double calls of ` # ensureAccessible ` for ` UnpooledHeapByteBuf ` .
Makes ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` and ` AbstractByteBuf # hashCode ` consistent ( # 7870 ) \n Motivation : \n The ` AbstractByteBuf # equals ` method doesn ' t take into account the \n class of buffer instance . So the two buffers with different classes \n must have the same ` hashCode ` values if ` equals ` method returns ` true ` . \n But ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` is not consistent with ` # hashCode ` \n of the empty ` AbstractByteBuf ` , that is violates the contract and \n can lead to errors . \n Modifications : \n Return ` 1 ` in ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` . \n Result : \n Consistent behavior of ` EmptyByteBuf # hashCode ` and ` AbstractByteBuf # hashCode ` .
Remove usage of idea file systems for checking js libraries \n The removed code is probably an outdated code from the age when Kotlin \n compiler was using VirtualFiles for operating . Previously the links were \n stored and passed further , but now it is only some additional check \n ( files are unused after the check ) with an implicit dependency to \n IDEA internals . \n The deleted check could probably be responsible for handling references \n to JS libraries because of the working compiler daemon . \n The code was spotted during an investigation for the \n 2bf22caeb7c687cd6b54b05b11e5c0f1a3caa07c commit ( there ' s a detailed \n description in the commit message ) .

Switch TextInput to useLayoutEffect \n Summary : \n This diff fixes an issue in ` TextInput ` where ` TextInputState . currentlyFocusedInputRef ` could maintain a ref to a view that no longer exists . This issue was exposed when upgrading React , where cleanups for passive effects are deferred . This change means that ` inputRef . current ` would no longer reference the host view * to be * destroyed ; it would be null because the view was * already destroyed * . \n There are two fixes here that would independently fix the bug and fix the issue better together . \n First , we convert ` useEffect ` to ` useLayoutEffect ` . ` useLayoutEffect ` is intended to fire synchronously after all host view mutations , and the cleanup function is intended to fire synchronously before the host view is destroyed , similar to the behavior assumed before . This change is now the correct function to use semantically . However , if we made this change without the second then any change in the order the effects fire would surface the same bug . \n So second , move the ` inputRefValue ) . blur ( ) ` call to the same effect as unregistering . This is because we currently require the ` blur ` effect to be called to null out ` currentlyFocusedInputRef ` in addition to calling ` unregisterInput ` . That makes the semantic ordering of effects in ` TextInput ` meaningful . Instead , when a TextInput is unregistered we should always ` blur ` to clear the ` currentlyFocusedInputRef ` , which will prevent dispatching events to a view that doesn ' t exist . If we made this change without the first then there ' s would be a race condition between calling blur on a TextInput and when that TextInput has been unregistered . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] \n Reviewed By : JoshuaGross \n Differential Revision : D23035358 \n fbshipit - source - id : ab686b8046d85e2becd8b879b0b4b7e69e672754

KQueue write filter initial state ( # 7738 ) \n Motivation : \n KQueue implementations current have inconsistent behavior with Epoll implementations with respect to asynchronous sockets and connecting . In the Epoll transport we attempt to connect , if the connect call does not synchornously fail / succeed we set the EPOLLOUT which will be triggered by the kernel if the connection attempt succeeds or an error occurs . The connect API provides no way to asynchronously communicate an error so the Epoll implementation fires a EPOLLOUT event and puts the connect status in getsockopt ( SO _ ERROR ) . KQueue provides the same APIs but different behavior . If the EVFILT _ WRITE is not enabled and the EVFILT _ READ is enabled before connect is called , and there is an error the kernel may fire the EVFILT _ READ filter and provide the Connection Refused error via read ( ) . This is even true if we set the EVFILT _ WRITE filter after calling connect because connect didn ' t synchornously complete . After the error has been delievered via read ( ) a call to getsockopt ( SO _ ERROR ) will return 0 indicating there is no error . This means we cannot rely upon the KQueue based kernel to deliver connection errors via the EVFILT _ WRITE filter in the same way that the linux kernel does with the EPOLLOUT flag . \n ce241bd introduced a change which depends upon the behavior of the EVFILT _ WRITE being set and may prematurely stop writing to the OS as a result , becaues we assume the OS will notify us when the socket is writable . However the current work around for the above described behavior is to initialize the EVFILT _ WRITE to true for connection oriented protocols . This leads to prematurely exiting from the flush ( ) which may lead to deadlock . \n Modifications : \n - KQueue should check when an error is obtained from read ( ) if the connectPromise has not yet been completed , and if not complete it with a ConnectException \n Result : \n No more deadlock in KQueue due to asynchronous connect workaround .
NioDatagramChannel invalid usage of internalNioBuffer \n Motivation : \n NioDatagramChannel attempts to unpack a AddressedEnvelope and unconditionally uses internalNioBuffer . However if the ByteBuf is a CompositeByteBuf with more than 1 components , the write will fail and throw an exception . \n Modifications : \n - NioDatagramChannel should check the nioBufferCount before attempting \n to use internalNioBuffer \n Result : \n No more failure to write UDP packets on NIO when a CompositeByteBuf is \n used .
Reduce the default number of objects retained by the Recycler per thread \n Motivation : \n The Recycler currently retains 32k objects per thread by default . The Recycler is used in more than just one place and may result in large amounts of memory bloat if spikes of traffic are observed . \n Modifications : \n - Reduce the Recyclers default capacity from 32k to 4k . \n Result : \n - Lower default capacity of the Recycler and less memory retained .
SmtpRequestEncoderTest ByteBuf leak ( # 9075 ) \n Motivation : \n SmtpRequestEncoderTest # testThrowsIfContentExpected has a ByteBuf leak . \n Modifications : \n - SmtpRequestEncoderTest # testThrowsIfContentExpected should release buffers in a finally block \n Result : \n No more leaks in SmtpRequestEncoderTest # testThrowsIfContentExpected .

RN : Remove ` RCTDeviceEventEmitter ` Checks \n Summary : \n Removes the checks in ` RCTDeviceEventEmitter ` that were initially added to migrate call sites to other modules when ` NativeEventEmitter ` was introduced . \n This set of checks is problematic for a few reasons : \n 1 . Does not cover many other events that have since been introduced , so the small list covered is arbitrary . \n 2 . Prevents composition of ` RCTDeviceEventEmitter ` in the implementation of those modules . \n 3 . Code bloat . \n Changelog : \n [ General ] [ Removed ] - ` RCTDeviceEventEmitter ` no longer throws for ` SttatusBar ` , ` Keyboard ` , and ` AppState ` events .

HUC regression test : disconnect in the middle of connecting . \n Prior to commit 084b06b48bae2b566bb1be3415b6c847d8ea3682 ( OkHttp 3 . 4 . 0 ) , \n a HttpURLConnection . disconnect ( ) in the middle of connecting caused an \n infinite loop . HUC does not claim to be thread safe , but concurrent \n disconnect should generally be supported ( it is supported by HttpEngine ) \n and this bug occurred even when the disconnect ( ) happened in the same \n thread , e . g . through the CookieJar . \n The infinite loop prior to that CL occurred because \n - The loop in HttpURLConnectionImpl . java : 418 did not check for the \n disconnected state , \n - { StreamAllocation , RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor } . recover ( ) returns \n true for canceled StreamAllocations / calls , but \n StreamAllocation . newStream ( ) immediately fails if already canceled . \n This bug was specific to HUC and did not affect the Call API because \n RetryAndFollowUpInterceptor ' s ( and , in earlier OkHttp versions , \n Call . getResponse ( ) ' s ) infinite loop did check the canceled case \n before proceeding . \n The bug existed since at least OkHttp 2 . 7 . 5 , likely introduced by \n commit c358656c8799d30fd422448153e99a5dd37e298a ( OkHttp 2 . 7 . 0 ) . \n The new test asserts that a disconnect ( ) while constructing the \n cookie headers leads to the new connection being aborted . It would \n also be permissible for the connection to succeed ( as long as it \n doesn ' t deadlock like it used to ) , but the stricter test seems \n reasonable to ensure that any behavior change is deliberate . \n A disconnect ( ) while accessing the Cache FileSystem has the same \n effect , but this is not covered by the added test because a \n new FileSystem wrapper class that delegates all calls would \n create code maintenance overhead .

The getIndices ( ) code mistakenly changed the vertices buffer where it formerly changed only the indices buffer . This caused crashes in ModelCacheTest when the Cache checkbox was selected and any model was added .
Prevent nesting of beginCache and begin , fixes # 4781
Check for 0 indices before attempting to set on copy . Fixes # 4775
Eliminate allocs - Buffer Paint . FontMetrics ( # 1892 ) \n paint . getFontMetrics ( ) has a hidden allocation . paint . getFontMetrics ( fontMetrics ) is used internally inside of Paint , so caching and holding onto a metrics buffer helps reduce allocations .

Fix race condition / crash while fetching Firebase token \n Fetching a Firebase token is an async operation . We need to wait \n for the operation to complete before calling getResult ( ) .

Fabric : Fixes in Android TextLayoutManager for better caching performance \n Summary : \n The is how it works : \n * Text is a quite special component with special properties and constraints . Some of them are : \n It ' s expensive to measure ( layout ) text . It ' s expensive to measure and expensive to pass AttributedString via JNI . \n * When we measure text , we don ' t concerned about maximum height , only maximum height is important . ( Even though theoretically , there are text layout systems that can balance these constraints ( max height and width ) trying to find a perfect result , we don ' t use such complex ( and expensive ) layout engines for building UIs ) . \n Yoga , as a flexbox engine , does not aware of such constraints , so it requests remeasuring of text components quite often , so we have an RN built - in text measure cache system just for text measurements that suit these constraints . This way when Yoga requests a text measuring , we always measure with ` Inf ` height and store that result in the cache . And when Yoga requests another measure with the same width but a different height we retrieve the value from the cache and then just clamp it . \n Changelog : [ Internal ] Fabric - specific internal change . \n Reviewed By : mdvacca \n Differential Revision : D26696637 \n fbshipit - source - id : f65b275d33c77073bc2359cbf0a741ddcf05d8d4

We therefore \n want to remove the checkState for Future . cancel ( ) ' s return value . \n However , it turned out that removing the checkState by itself would cause some \n dynamic builds to fail : if the future of the strategy calling stopBranch ( ) was \n itself cancelled but not interrupted ( a situation that sometimes arises ) , both \n branches could attempt to write outputs . The IllegalStateException thrown by \n checkState had the effect of interrupting the cancelled branch , allowing the build \n to succeed most of the time , as long as the exception got caught somewhere ( which \n it often was ) . \n We therefore want to replace the implicit effect of the misleading checkState with \n an explicit check for a cancelled strategy and an explicit interruption . \n RELNOTES : None . \n PiperOrigin - RevId : 342340917
